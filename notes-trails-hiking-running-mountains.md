## What is this?

This is the "trails, hiking and running mountains" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

Relatedly, I aspire towards the vision Tiago Forte fleshes out in his [digital notes as second brain essay](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/edit/master/notes-memory-cognition-teaching-learning.md#Offload-thinking-to-second-brain).

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

### Why say hello to fellow hikers?
([overview](#overview))

Found this passage from the beginning of Sarah Constantin's essay [The face of the ice](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/05/30/the-face-of-the-ice/), which is about something else:

```markdown
My father was a serious alpinist in his youth, and taught us a few things about mountains
when we were kids.  For instance: you always say hello to people you pass on the mountain.

Why? Because the mountain can kill you.  “Hi” means “You are a human like me, and this 
mountain is our common threat. If you scream for help, I will come for you.”

There’s a certain solidarity between humans that emerges when we’re faced with a potentially
hostile natural world.  If we passed on the street, we’d be strangers. There’d be no bond
between us.  We might even engage in conflict, under the right circumstances. But on the 
mountain, all of that falls away.  By default, in the wilderness, a human face is a friendly 
face, a glad thing to see if you are lost or hurt.

If you are in the desert and you see someone obviously suffering from dehydration, you’ll
share your extra water with them. It won’t feel like some kind of altruism or charity, it
will feel *obvious*. It’s instructive, if you’re used to thinking of giving as an 
unpleasant duty, to experience some situations where it’s *natural* to be kind.  Kindness 
becomes practical and natural and obvious when the physical environment is hostile.  
Suddenly everything becomes simple: it’s human life against bitter nature, and nothing
else matters.  “All men are brothers” becomes a concrete reality.

There’s something clarifying about man vs. nature situations, even at the minimal level you
can experience by hiking a technical scramble alone.  I’ve found that a certain alertness
kicks in when I have to figure out where to put my hands and feet; I’m scared of falling, 
I have a heightened awareness of physical/spatial reality, and I don’t care at *all* about
looking foolish or getting dirt on my clothes, because *the important thing is to get off 
the damn mountain without any injuries*.  I also am much less lazy; “get to the top” or “get
to the bottom” make it feel natural to push a lot harder than “run X miles” or “lift X 
pounds,” almost as though reaching topographical milestones taps into some primal source of
motivation.  Mountains make life more *real* than it usually is in civilized life.

There’s a traditional overlap between mountain climbing and math; the Russians had their 
math camps in the Urals for decades. Alan Turing, Sophus Lie, Niels Abel , and many others
were avid hikers; a disturbing number of mathematicians have died in hiking accidents.  If
I can speculate about the connection, it might have something to do with love of solitude,
tolerance for pain and effort, or this heightened-reality effect from spatial problem-
solving.  I certainly get a disproportionate number of good ideas while on runs, bike rides,
hikes, or long walks alone.

### Tuttle Creek to Mt Langley
([overview](#overview))

I can't believe I've never heard of this trail before stumbling upon [this SummitPost report](https://www.summitpost.org/tuttle-creek-to-mount-langley/314792). Cactus to Clouds has more gain of course, but it's also gentler. Even the steep initial portion of C2C, 8,000' in 11 miles, pales in comparison to TCL's 7,100' in a relentless, astonishing 4.5 miles -- and a lot of that includes gentle slopes, which means there are even steeper sections, needing Class 4 bouldering (although the hiker contends you can figure out a route around those, he didn't have to look because those sections were easy enough already). The hiker (can't figure out his name) took 7.5 hours to get to the top "at a fast pace" and 3.5 hours down. 

The overview is very understated. It just assumes you're a next-level hiker:

```markdown
This is a trail description that starts at Tuttle Creek trail head and goes to the peak of
Mount Langley. This trail is 4.5 miles (9 miles round trip). The trail head is at about 6,900'
and Mount Langley is 14,026', for a gain of over 7,100'. It is a very strenuous day hike or 
could be done as an overnight. This is an alternate route to the more popular route over New
Army Pass, it also gains more elevation, so is more difficult. This route starts at the Tuttle
Creek trail head and follows along Tuttle Creek, but just to the Ashram, after that it vears
away up an avalache chute.
```

I actually found out about it in an offhand remark by a commenter in the Mt Whitney FB Group on a post bitching about inexperienced hikers endangering themselves by attempting Mt Whitney and snagging permits from more experienced (and now disgruntled) hikers. The commenter said to try this route out, since (1) it doesn't require permits (2) the trailhead is right next to Lone Pine:

```markdown
Tuttle Creek trail head is just a few miles out of Lone Pine. Head up Whitney Portal and turn
South on Horseshoe Meadows Road. Turn West on Granite View Drive. You will now be looking up 
the beautiful and rugged Tuttle Creek Canyon, a rock climbers paradise. Pass south of the 
campground, after you pass a house right next to the South side of the road, start watching for 
a branch in the road on the North side that heads up toward the canyon. The road skirts along 
the canyon, high above the stream and is passable with two wheel drive. There is a turn around 
at the trail head. 
```

Apparently the couloir is 3 times the size of the chute on Mt Whitney's MR, per this report:

```markdown
Conditions were hot, clear, and dry. After departing the well-defined trail to the Ashram, 
I bushwhacked for an hour and only went about a quarter mile and 700 ft gain due to my poor
route-finding and trail-recognition skills. 

Finally getting back to the west side of the creek, there appeared no defined trail, however
navigation is easy from this point on - it's just a long sand slog for the next few miles and
5000 ft of elevation gain. 

I don't know an exact elevation, but there was no water in the creek once above 9000-10000 ft.
There was a small snowfield along the route around 11500 ft, which I used to refill my
reservoir both ascending and descending. 

Langley comes into view only once you gain the ridgeline around 12000 ft., the top of its 
characteristic eastern couloir still holding some snow. As I gain elevation and more of the
couloir comes into view, I am glad I chose the sand-slog - the couloir is mostly bare and the
talus scramble would've been no fun (this couloir is 3 times the size of the chute on Whitney's
Mountaineers Route, and that talus scramble is a pain).
```
