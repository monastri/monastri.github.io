I liked this essay by John Nerst: [Partial Derivatives and Partial Narratives](https://everythingstudies.com/2016/06/02/partial-derivatives-and-partial-narratives/).
But it's a bit too long for me to "see all at once", so here's a quick working summary in "tweetstorm" format (following Venkat Rao). 

I still don't know how to use LaTeX in Markdown yet. The solution below is a temporary stopgap, to be replaced as soon as I find something better.

### Understanding narratives via function derivatives

1. If you think of functions as ordered pairs, then derivatives can be thought of as how the pair members dynamically (or "causally") relate to each other.
2. Derivatives *destroy information*. For instance, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;f'(x)&space;=&space;3&space;\Rightarrow&space;f(x)&space;=&space;3x&space;&plus;&space;C" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;f'(x)&space;=&space;3&space;\Rightarrow&space;f(x)&space;=&space;3x&space;&plus;&space;C" title="f'(x) = 3 \Rightarrow f(x) = 3x + C" /></a>.
People often forget that this derivative describes not a single function but an *infinite family* of them, related ("parametrized") by the constant C.
3. Multivariate functions have many different *partial* derivatives, which can look nothing alike. For instance, the partial derivatives of <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;f(x,y,z)&space;=&space;2x&plus;100y-3z^2" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;f(x,y,z)&space;=&space;2x&plus;100y-3z^2" title="f(x,y,z) = 2x+100y-3z^2" /></a> are 2, 100, and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\inline&space;-6z" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;-6z" title="-6z" /></a>.
4. Partial derivatives "put one variable into focus", so the causal dynamic becomes "about that variable". Everything else becomes a cast of supporting characters.

### Where narratives come into the picture

3. A narrative is an account of the causal relationship between events and entities.
4. A simple causal narrative might be "I dropped the plate and it broke". 
5. Most narratives aren't this simple, because
