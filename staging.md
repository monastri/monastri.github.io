## Psychological gulfs
([overview](#overview))

Spencer Greenberg has a [list of psychological gulfs](https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103598358776962), common differences between people that are so large that those at the opposite extreme ends of the trait (say, the 5th percentile vs. 95th percentile) have a very hard time understanding and relating to each other -- note that each of these examples is supposed to illustrate a somewhat extreme form of each trait for clarity purposes; most people who have or lack each trait don’t have a form that is as extreme as is shown in these examples.

Extraversion vs. Introversion:

```markdown
“Are you coming out? It’s going to be a HUGE night! First we’re meeting up with 
Bill, Harry and Jennifer for drinks. Then stopping by the party to see the whole
crew, and after, if we’re feeling it, we’ll hit up Sing Song karaoke. Then we’re
hitting the clubs for the rest of the night!”

“Thanks…I appreciate the invite. I’m just going to stay in tonight though. I’ve 
really been loving this book I’m reading. All week I’ve been looking forward to 
having the time to finish it.”
```

Conscientiousness vs. Easy goingness:

```markdown
“I can’t believe how much material this exam is going to cover! I still need to 
make an outline of all the material, and flashcards. Last time I color coded my 
outline which worked really well, though it took a long time to make. I might 
borrow outlines from a couple other people to see how they organize the material. 
I’m going to be up until 2am tonight at least.”

“Me too…but more like 4am. I have a date with World of Warcraft. You do realize
this test only counts for 5% of our grade, right? I might just skip the exam
actually.”
```

Social awareness vs. Social unawareness:

```markdown
“Let’s go talk to Sally over there, she clearly wants to get out of that 
conversation with Bill. Plus, I should introduce her to Ethan.”

“Wait, who’s Sally again…is she one of the new engineers? How do you know she 
doesn’t like Bill, did she tell you that? And is Ethan even here tonight??? Why 
do you want to introduce them to each other anyway?”
```

Emotionality vs. Stability:

```markdown
“Sometimes life is so intense that I almost can’t take it. I’ll just burst out 
in tears in the middle of the day and have to hide in the bathroom at work. I 
wouldn’t have it any other way though, it’s what makes life so meaningful.”

“Crying at work you mean? I’ve done that too actually. I was at work when I found
out my sister had died. It was really tough. Actually though, now that I think 
about it, I finished out my shift since I only had 5 minutes of it left anyway.
And I don’t think I cried until later that night when I was at home alone.”
```

Aesthetic sensitivity vs. Aesthetic indifference:

```markdown
“Did you see the colors he painted his walls??? They made my skin crawl.”

“Wait, what color were they? And how is it even possible for colors to make your
skin crawl???”
```

Empathy vs. Unsympatheticness:

```markdown
“Please, please don’t use glue traps. Once the mouse is stuck it will slowly starve
to death. What if I help you trap it and then we can find a good place to release 
it outside?”

“Are you kidding me? We’re talking about a mouse! If the stupid thing weren’t so 
damn fast I’d just stamp right on its head with my boots, that would take so much
less time.”
```

Anxiety vs. Calmness:

```markdown
“I’ve been worried all day because I’ve been waiting for the doctor to call me
with my test results. I mean, I know I probably will test negative, but what if
I don’t? I wouldn’t be able to stay in school anymore, and I’m not sure I could
afford the medical bills. Even if there is a 1% that I test positive, the
consequences would just be so serious that it’s still a big deal. And my chances
might even be worse than 1%! I really don’t need this right now, I was already
really worried about the presentation I have to give to the CEO at the end of the
month. What is life going to throw at me next?”

“Honestly, you just need to relax. What’s the point of worrying about all this?
Worrying doesn’t change anything and you’re just stressing yourself out. Like 
you said, you're really unlikely to test positive. Everything is going to be
totally fine in the end."
```

Openness vs. Closedness:

```markdown
“That was the coolest lecture ever, I’m so inspired right now. I can only BEGIN 
to imagine what it’s like to be Prism, as a visually impaired Chinese Italian non
gender binary person who has spent fifteen years fighting for the medical 
establishment to finally recognize the alternative medical treatments that cured
his own cancer! Prism has so many interesting ideas about relationships and child
rearing too. I’m also really excited now to buy a few books on the diversity of 
social practices among First Nations people.”

“Seriously, you enjoyed that??? That was literally the weirdest thing I’ve ever 
experienced. I wanted to puke when he made us all put our arms around each other 
in a circle and try to open our ‘inner eye’. What does that even mean??? Not to
mention that half the people there were out of it on drugs of some kind. And why
on earth was that woman practically naked?”
```

Authoritarianism vs. Libertarianism:

```markdown
“If your father wants you to move in with him and your mom, then that’s your duty 
as their child. Maybe your pastor can give you advice for how to make it a smooth 
transition.”

“It was my parents choice to have me. Just because they made that choice doesn’t 
mean they have control over my life. Are you serious that if you were me you would
talk to a pastor for advice? Sure, I’m spiritual. But I don’t belong to a church 
or follow one particular set of teachings, I prefer to figure out myself what 
religion and spirituality mean.”
```

Jess Riedel suggests "individualism vs collectivism" might be a better way to carve *individual* psychology at the joints:

```markdown
There seems to a huge difference between folks who see the world in terms of 
interacting individual humans vs. interacting groups of humans (or memes/concepts
that propagate within groups), where the groups are said to be effectively
irreducible for the purpose of useful analysis.
```

Optimism vs. Pessimism:

```markdown
“I can’t wait until vacation! We’re going to have such an incredible time together. 
And it’s going to be such a well deserved break after all this hard work. Plus, 
they’re going to announce bonuses right before we leave. Business has been great,
I bet they’ll be the biggest bonuses yet. When we’re lying on the beach we can 
discuss the fun things we’re going to buy with all that money!”

“Vacation will be pretty fun I guess. But I’ve been thinking…the beaches get so
crowded during the vacation season, maybe it would make more sense to just stay 
home this year. It’s pretty pointless just lying on the beach all day anyway. I 
know you’re excited about bonuses, but I don’t want you to get your hopes up. 
Business looked good this year, but our industry is about to get squeezed with 
all the new technology coming to market. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t 
even give us bonuses. After all, we work at a company that tries to convince 
consumers to buy meaningless shit they don’t need, so why would the company care
about making its employees happy?”
```

Sexuality vs. Asexuality:

```markdown
“This club is amazing…it has the hottest people I’ve ever seen! I would literally
sleep with anyone here. It’s hard to even focus on this conversation!”

“Oh…hmm, I guess you’re right, there are a lot of good looking people here. All
the skin tight clothing and showing off of skin seems a bit gratuitous though, 
don’t you think?”
```

Analyticalness vs. Intuitiveness:

```markdown
“I’ve been thinking about social interaction a lot lately, and currently my best
framework for how to start a conversation with a stranger is to make a comment 
about something in the surrounding context that you know the other person is 
already aware of. For instance, about the weather, but only if the weather is well
above or below average for that season. Then, once the other person responds to
your comment, you should ask them a question related to their response to get them
talking further. If the person gives a really short response to your question then
it probably means…”

“Can I stop you right there? Honestly, if you’re analyzing how to have social 
interaction you’re already doing it wrong. Just get a feel for what the other person
is like. Then just say whatever feels most natural to say. Don’t overthink everything!”
```

Self admiration vs. Self doubt:

```markdown
“There are very few incredible people in the world. What are the chances that two truly
unique and awesome people would find each other? It’s one in a million. You’re
unbelievably special, and it couldn’t be more obvious that we’re meant to be together. 
I think that as a team we could achieve just about anything.”

“You keep calling me special, but honestly, I’m embarrassed to admit it, but there’s
nothing special about me. Nearly everything I’ve achieved was just a result of good 
luck, or having unfair opportunities that other people don’t get, and I’m probably one
of the least talented people to achieve what I’ve achieved. Eventually people will
figure that out about me and it will all come crashing down. And when I get good 
opportunities I usually just mess them up or undermine myself. If there’s anything 
special about me, it’s that there’s something wrong with me. I screw things up. 
Fundamentally, not only am I ordinary, but I’m not even an especially good person, and
I don’t deserve much of anything.”
```

Jess Riedel adds "the degree to which the person thinks in terms of normative vs. positive statements":

```markdown
I have been surprised at how difficult it is for me to communicate with folks 
who, by my lights, are unable to discuss a topic without framing it in terms of
value judgements.
```

## Ask vs guess vs tell culture
([overview](#overview))

Some psychological gulfs have been discussed much more than others. One of them is ask vs guess vs tell, which I first encountered in these two posts written 4 years apart: [Ask and guess culture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy/ask-and-guess) and [tell culture](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rEBXN3x6kXgD4pLxs/tell-culture). The first originates with [tangerine's Metafilter post](https://ask.metafilter.com/55153/Whats-the-middle-ground-between-FU-and-Welcome), the second comes from Brienne Yudkowsky.

Basic rules of ask culture:

```markdown
1) Ask when you want something. 
2) Interpret things as requests and feel free to say "no".
```

Example:

```markdown
"I'll be in town this weekend for a business trip. Is it cool if I crash at your 
place?" 

Response: “Yes“ or “no”.
```

Basic rules of guess culture:

```markdown
1) Ask for things if, and *only* if, you're confident the person will say "yes". 
2) Interpret requests as expectations of "yes", and, when possible, avoid saying "no". 
```

Example: 

```markdown
"Hey, great news! I'll be in town this weekend for a business trip!"

Response: Infer that they might be telling you this because they want something from
you, conclude that they might want a place to stay, and offer your hospitality only 
if you want to. Otherwise, pretend you didn’t infer that.
```

Basic rules of tell culture:

```markdown
1) Tell the other person what's going on in your own mind whenever you suspect you'd
both benefit from them knowing. (Do NOT assume others will accurately model your mind 
without your help, or that it will even occur to them to ask you questions to
eliminate their ignorance.) 

2) Interpret things people tell you as attempts to create common knowledge for shared
benefit, rather than as requests or as presumptions of compliance.
```

Example:

```markdown
"I'll be in town this weekend for a business trip. I would like to stay at your place,
since it would save me the cost of a hotel, plus I would enjoy seeing you and expect
we’d have some fun. I'm looking for other options, though, and would rather stay 
elsewhere than inconvenience you." 

Response: “I think I need some space this weekend. But I’d love to get a beer or 
something while you’re in town!” or “You should totally stay with me. I’m looking 
forward to it.”
```

What's the difference between ask and tell again?

```markdown
The burden of honesty is even greater in Tell culture than in Ask culture. To a Guess
culture person, I imagine much of the above sounds passive aggressive or manipulative, 
much worse than the rude bluntness of mere Ask. It’s because Guess people aren’t 
expecting relentless truth-telling. 

Tell culture is cooperation with open source codes.
```

Tangerine's now-classic Metafilter post introducing the ask vs guess culture distinction:

```markdown
In some families, you grow up with the expectation that it's OK to ask for anything
at all, but you gotta realize you might get no for an answer. This is Ask Culture.

In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure 
the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations.
A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety,
you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, 
the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to
discern whether you should accept.

All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person -- 
and you obviously are -- then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem 
presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and
manipulated.

If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible,
inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression. ...

Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who
share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther 
you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to
embrace Ask behavior. Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at 
(pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone.
```

The ask vs guess divide isn't as clear as you think:

```markdown
Some *individual people* are more comfortable asking than guessing, and vice versa.

Some families, and some cultures, are more "ask-based" than "guess-based."  
(Apparently East Asia is more "guess-based" than the US.)

It also varies from situation to situation: "Will you marry me?" is a question you
should only ask if you know the answer is yes, but "Would you like to get coffee 
with me?" is the kind of question you should ask freely and not worry too much about
rejection. 
```

Nancy Lebovitz contends that it should be called 'Infer' culture instead:

```markdown
It's how Infer cultures look to people who don't know the rules.
```

TheOtherDave:

```markdown
Guess cultures mostly don't involve guesswork. They involve inferring likely
conditions based on evidence that isn't explicitly articulated.

More precisely: Culture A is an Ask culture relative to Culture B with respect to a 
subject if A explicitly articulates things about that subject that B doesn't 
articulate.

So I think your question is isomorphic to "Why would anyone prefer not to explicitly
articulate all their evidence?"... that is, "Why are some things rude to talk about?"
```

Some advice for experimenting with asking as a guesser:

```markdown
- failure/rejection is so common as to not be shameful (i.e. dating)

- it's someone's job to handle requests, and requests are common (e.g. applying for 
jobs or awards, academic administration)

- granting or refusing a request is ridiculously easy (most internet communication)
```

A bit more nuance on ask vs guess by commenter TheOtherDave:

```markdown
Ask and Guess are sometimes misleading labels for the styles they refer to (though
they are conventional).

For example, "Ask" culture is often OK with "So, I'm assuming here that A, B, and C 
are true; based on that yadda yadda" with the *implicit expectation* is that someone 
will correct me if I'm wrong. In "Guess" culture this sort of thing carries the equally
*implicit expectation* that nobody will correct me. Here both groups are guessing, but
they guess differently.

"Guess" culture also has an implicit expectation in some cases that you do ask, but that
an honest answer is not actually permitted... the answer is constrained by the social 
rules. For example, growing up if a guest says "Well, we should get going." the host is
obligated to reply "Oh, but we're having such a good time!" and none of that actually
lets you know whether the guest is still welcome or not (or, indeed, whether the guest 
has any desire to stay or go).
```

In *The Screwtape Letters*, C.S. Lewis comes down hard on guess culture by introducing what he calls the Generous Conflict Illusion:

```markdown
Later on you can venture on what may be called the Generous Conflict Illusion. This game 
is best played with more than two players, in a family with grown-up children for example.

Something quite trivial, like having tea in the garden, is proposed. One member takes care
to make it quite clear (though not in so many words) that he would rather not but is, of 
course, prepared to do so out of "Unselfishness". The others instantly withdraw their 
proposal, ostensibly through their "Unselfishness", but really because they don't want to
be used as a sort of lay figure on which the first speaker practices petty altruisms. 

But he is not going to be done out of his debauch of Unselfishness either. He insists on 
doing "what the others want". They insist on doing what he wants. Passions are roused. Soon 
someone is saying "Very well then, I won't have any tea at all!", and a real quarrel ensues 
with bitter resentment on both sides. 

You see how it is done? If each side had been frankly contending for its own real wish, they
would all have kept within the bounds of reason and courtesy; but just because the contention
is reversed and each side is fighting the other side's battle, all the bitterness which really 
flows from thwarted self-righteousness and obstinacy and the accumulated grudges of the last 
ten years is concealed from them by the nominal or official "Unselfishness" of what they are 
doing or, at least, held to be excused by it.
```

Isn't ask culture just *better* all around? Scott Alexander responds with a parable:

```markdown
Consider an "ask culture" where employees consider themselves totally allowed to say "no"
without repercussions. 

The boss would prefer people work unpaid overtime so ey gets more work done without having 
to pay anything, so ey asks everyone. Most people say no, because they hate unpaid overtime. 
The only people who agree will be those who really love the company or their job - they end up
looking really good. 

More and more workers realize the value of lying and agreeing to work unpaid overtime so the 
boss thinks they really love the company. Eventually, the few workers who continue refusing 
look really bad, like they're the only ones who aren't team players, and they grudgingly accept.

Only now the boss notices that the employees hate their jobs and hate the boss. The boss decides
to only ask employees if they will work unpaid overtime when it's absolutely necessary. The ask 
culture has become a guess culture.
```

Another reason is signaling people understanding:

```markdown
Guesser culture affords much more signaling of how well you understand people. People who
correctly guess will come off as more intelligent, observant and understanding. It's like
the difference between offering money and offering carefully chosen presents; money may be
more efficient, but efficiency isn't the only factor coming into account.

Interestingly, Chinese culture seems much more guess-based than American culture, but in 
China gifts are usually in cash, not in presents. Maybe societies all need a way to signal
understanding and social suaveness, but choose different mechanisms.
```

Another reason is that there are things it's impolite to express in any words because the *sentiment* is impolite. Relsqui:

```markdown
There are some things which it's impolite to say, in any words, because the sentiment is
impolite--for example, "I don't want you to come to my party." Guess culture, applied 
well, allows you to avoid having to say those things or cause the attendant hurt feelings.
(Guess culture applied poorly avoids the hurt feelings but puts you in the awkward
position where they're at the party anyway because you felt compelled to invite them.) The
same situation in ask culture requires you come out with it.

This may sound like a good thing in the long run--especially if you are yourself asky--but
sometimes there are valid reasons both that you don't want someone at the party (they smell
bad) and that you don't want to hurt their feelings (they're your boss/family member/other
person you'll be spending more time around, especially in a position of authority).
```

Another reason is keeping secrets:

```markdown
In ask culture, if someone asks you something you've promised not to tell, it's certainly
valid to say "Sorry, I can't tell you." But then they know there's a secret, and sometimes
that alone is enough to cause harm--through speculation and deduction, or asking someone 
else, for example. (You could also lie, but that might cause its own problems.) In guess 
culture, there are things you don't ask about. This is part of why.
```

In fact, guess culture seems to be a Nash equilibrium for most human collectives:

```markdown
Ya know, after thousands of years of trying it out in all kinds of environments, it seems 
as though almost every culture on Earth settles on "Guess", with maybe a touch of "Ask" in
the more overbearing ones. A common modification to "Guess" is "Offer", where the mere 
mention of a possible opportunity to help out is treated as creating almost a positive
obligation to notice the need and make a spontaneous offer.

From where I sit, that's pretty strong evidence that "Guess" or maybe "Offer" is more suited 
to collective human nature. There's a pretty heavy burden of proof on any "rationalist" who
wants to change it.

It's also not so obvious that you can effectively change conventions like these by just
starting in and asking others to change. If you tried your "developing trust" tactic with me,
I'd probably play along to avoid conflict on one occasion, and avoid YOU after that. ...

It's evidence that Guess is the Nash equilibrium that human cultures find. Consider that the
Nash equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma (and in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with known 
fixed length) is both defect. It's a common theme in game theory that the Nash equilibrium is
not always the best place to be.
```

Okay, when should you go for tell culture? Example from Brienne:

```markdown
Suppose you’re in a conversation that you’re finding aversive, and you can’t figure out why.
Your goal is to procure a rain check.

- Guess: *You see this annoyed body language? Huh? Look at it! If you don’t stop talking soon
I swear I’ll start tapping my foot.* (Or, possibly, tell a little lie to excuse yourself. 
“Oh, look at the time…”) 

- Ask: “Can we talk about this another time?”

- Tell: "I'm beginning to find this conversation aversive, and I'm not sure why. I propose
we hold off until I've figured that out."
```

Julia Galef pushes back, saying this "can become an excuse to abdicate responsibility for your effect on other people":

```markdown
There are plenty of times when I agree a policy of frankness can be useful, but one of the 
risks of such a policy is that it can become an excuse to abdicate responsibility for your 
effect on other people.

If you tell me that you're having an aversive reaction to our conversation, but can't tell 
me why, it's going to stress me out, and I'm going to feel compelled to go back over our 
conversation to see if I can figure out what I did to cause that reaction in you. That's a 
non-negligible burden to dump on someone.

If, instead, you found an excuse to leave the conversation gracefully (no need for annoyed
body language), you can reflect on the conversation later and decide if there is anything 
in particular I did to cause your aversive reaction. Maybe so, and you want to bring it up
with me later. Or maybe you decide you overreacted to a comment I made, which you now believe
you misinterpreted. Or maybe you decide you were just anxious about something unrelated. 
Overall, chances are good that you can save me a lot of stress and self-consciousness by 
dealing with your emotions yourself as a first pass, and making them my problem only if 
(upon reflection) you decide that it would be helpful to do so.
