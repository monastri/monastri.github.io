### Evolution as alien god
([overview](#overview))	

From Eliezer Yudkowsky's [epomymously titled LW essay](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLRogvJLPPg6Mrvg4/an-alien-god), which pretty much set the template for how I think about evolution all those years back:

```markdown
A human being, looking at the natural world, sees a thousand times *purpose*. A rabbit's legs, built and articulated for running; a fox's jaws, built and articulated for tearing. But what you see is not exactly what is there...

In the days before Darwin, the cause of all this apparent *purposefulness* was a very great puzzle unto science. The Goddists said "God did it", because you get 50 bonus points each time you use the word "God" in a sentence. Yet perhaps I'm being unfair. In the days before Darwin, it seemed like a much more reasonable hypothesis. Find a watch in the desert, said William Paley, and you can infer the existence of a watchmaker.

But when you look at *all* the apparent purposefulness in Nature, rather than picking and choosing your examples, you start to notice things that don't fit the Judeo-Christian concept of one benevolent God. Foxes seem well-designed to catch rabbits. Rabbits seem well-designed to evade foxes. Was the Creator having trouble making up Its mind?

When I design a toaster oven, I don't design one part that tries to get electricity to the coils and a second part that tries to prevent electricity from getting to the coils. It would be a waste of effort. Who designed the ecosystem, with its predators and prey, viruses and bacteria? Even the cactus plant, which you might think well-designed to provide water fruit to desert animals, is covered with inconvenient spines.

The ecosystem would make much more sense if it wasn't designed by a unitary Who, but, rather, created by a horde of deities—say from the Hindu or Shinto religions. This handily explains both the ubiquitous purposefulnesses, and the ubiquitous conflicts: More than one deity acted, often at cross-purposes. The fox and rabbit were both designed, but by distinct competing deities. ...

Similarly, the Judeo-Christian God is alleged to be benevolent—well, sort of. And yet much of nature's purposefulness seems downright cruel. Darwin suspected a non-standard Creator for studying Ichneumon wasps, whose paralyzing stings preserve its prey to be eaten alive by its larvae: "I cannot persuade myself," wrote Darwin, "that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice." ...

Evolution doesn't allow just any kind of purposefulness to leak into Nature. That's what makes evolution a success as an empirical hypothesis. If evolutionary biology could explain a toaster oven, not just a tree, it would be worthless. There's a lot more to evolutionary theory than pointing at Nature and saying, "Now purpose is allowed," or "Evolution did it!" The strength of a theory is not what it allows, but what it prohibits; if you can invent an equally persuasive explanation for any outcome, you have zero knowledge.

"Many non-biologists," observed George Williams, "think that it is for their benefit that rattles grow on rattlesnake tails." Bzzzt! This kind of purposefulness is not allowed. Evolution doesn't work by letting flashes of purposefulness creep in at random—reshaping one species for the benefit of a random recipient.

Evolution is powered by a systematic correlation between the different ways that different genes construct organisms, and how many copies of those genes make it into the next generation. For rattles to grow on rattlesnake tails, rattle-growing genes must become more and more frequent in each successive generation. (Actually genes for incrementally more complex rattles, but if I start describing all the fillips and caveats to evolutionary biology, we really will be here all day.)

There isn't an Evolution Fairy that looks over the current state of Nature, decides what would be a "good idea", and chooses to increase the frequency of rattle-constructing genes.

I suspect this is where a lot of people get stuck, in evolutionary biology. They understand that "helpful" genes become more common, but "helpful" lets any sort of purpose leak in. They don't think there's an Evolution Fairy, yet they ask which genes will be "helpful" as if a rattlesnake gene could "help" non-rattlesnakes.

The key realization is that *there is no Evolution Fairy*. There's no outside force deciding which genes ought to be promoted. Whatever happens, happens *because* of the genes themselves.

Genes for constructing (incrementally better) rattles, must have somehow ended up more frequent in the rattlesnake gene pool, because of the rattle. In this case it's probably because rattlesnakes with better rattles survive more often—rather than mating more successfully, or having brothers that reproduce more successfully, etc.

Maybe predators are wary of rattles and don't step on the snake. Or maybe the rattle diverts attention from the snake's head.

But that's just a snake's rattle. There are much more complicated ways that a gene can cause copies of itself to become more frequent in the next generation. Your brother or sister shares half your genes. A gene that sacrifices one unit of resources to bestow three units of resource on a brother, may promote some copies of itself by sacrificing one of its constructed organisms. 

The main point is that the gene's effect must cause copies of that gene to become more frequent in the next generation. There's no Evolution Fairy that reaches in from outside. There's nothing which decides that some genes are "helpful" and should, therefore, increase in frequency. It's just cause and effect, starting from the genes themselves.

This explains the strange conflicting purposefulness of Nature, and its frequent cruelty. It explains even better than a horde of Shinto deities.

Why is so much of Nature at war with other parts of Nature? Because there isn't one Evolution directing the whole process. There's as many different "evolutions" as reproducing populations. Rabbit genes are becoming more or less frequent in rabbit populations. Fox genes are becoming more or less frequent in fox populations. Fox genes which construct foxes that catch rabbits, insert more copies of themselves in the next generation. Rabbit genes which construct rabbits that evade foxes are naturally more common in the next generation of rabbits. Hence the phrase "natural selection".

Why is Nature cruel? You, a human, can look at an Ichneumon wasp, and decide that it's cruel to eat your prey alive. You can decide that if you're going to eat your prey alive, you can at least have the decency to stop it from hurting. It would scarcely cost the wasp anything to anesthetize its prey as well as paralyze it. Or what about old elephants, who die of starvation when their last set of teeth fall out? These elephants aren't going to reproduce anyway. What would it cost evolution—the evolution of elephants, rather—to ensure that the elephant dies right away, instead of slowly and in agony? What would it cost evolution to anesthetize the elephant, or give it pleasant dreams before it dies? Nothing; that elephant won't reproduce more or less either way.

If you were talking to a fellow human, trying to resolve a conflict of interest, you would be in a good negotiating position—would have an easy job of persuasion. It would cost so little to anesthetize the prey, to let the elephant die without agony! Oh please, won't you do it, kindly... um...

There's no one to argue with.

Humans, who are often deeply concerned for the well-being of animals, can be very persuasive in arguing how various kindnesses wouldn't harm reproductive fitness at all. Sadly, the evolution of elephants doesn't use a similar algorithm; it doesn't select nice genes that can plausibly be argued to help reproductive fitness. Simply: genes that replicate more often become more frequent in the next generation. Like water flowing downhill, and equally benevolent.

A human, looking over Nature, starts thinking of all the ways we would design organisms. And then we tend to start rationalizing reasons why our design improvements would increase reproductive fitness—a political instinct, trying to sell your own preferred option as matching the boss's favored justification.

And so, amateur evolutionary biologists end up making all sorts of wonderful and completely mistaken predictions. Because the amateur biologists are drawing their bottom line—and more importantly, locating their prediction in hypothesis-space—using a different algorithm than evolutions use to draw their bottom lines.

A human engineer would have designed human taste buds to measure how much of each nutrient we had, and how much we needed. When fat was scarce, almonds or cheeseburgers would taste delicious. But if you started to become obese, or if vitamins were lacking, lettuce would taste delicious. But there is no Evolution of Humans Fairy, which intelligently planned ahead and designed a general system for every contingency. It was a reliable invariant of humans' ancestral environment that calories were scarce. So genes whose organisms loved calories, became more frequent. Like water flowing downhill.

We are simply the embodied history of which organisms *did in fact* survive and reproduce, not which organisms *ought prudentially to have* survived and reproduced.
```

And here's the memorable "alien god" part:

```markdown
Find a watch in a desert, said William Paley, and you can infer the watchmaker. There were once those who denied this, who thought that life "just happened" without need of an optimization process, mice being spontaneously generated from straw and dirty shirts.

If we ask who was *more* correct—the theologians who argued for a Creator-God, or the intellectually unfulfilled atheists who argued that mice spontaneously generated—then the theologians must be declared the victors: evolution is not God, but it is closer to God than it is to pure random entropy. Mutation is random, but selection is non-random. This doesn't mean an intelligent Fairy is reaching in and selecting. It means there's a non-zero statistical correlation between the gene and how often the organism reproduces. Over a few million years, that non-zero statistical correlation adds up to something very powerful. It's not a god, but it's more closely akin to a god than it is to snow on a television screen.

In a lot of ways, evolution *is* like unto theology. "Gods are ontologically distinct from creatures," said Damien Broderick, "or they're not worth the paper they're written on." And indeed, the Shaper of Life is not itself a creature. Evolution is bodiless, like the Judeo-Christian deity. Omnipresent in Nature, immanent in the fall of every leaf. Vast as a planet's surface. Billions of years old. Itself unmade, arising naturally from the structure of physics. Doesn't that all sound like something that might have been said about God?

And yet the Maker has no mind, as well as no body. In some ways, its handiwork is incredibly poor design by human standards. It is internally divided. Most of all, it isn't *nice*.

In a way, Darwin *discovered* God—a God that failed to match the preconceptions of theology, and so passed unheralded. If Darwin had discovered that life was created by an intelligent agent—a bodiless mind that loves us, and will smite us with lightning if we dare say otherwise—people would have said "My gosh! That's God!"

But instead Darwin discovered a strange alien God—not comfortably "ineffable", but *really genuinely different from us*. Evolution is not a God, but if it were, it wouldn't be Jehovah. It would be H. P. Lovecraft's Azathoth, the blind idiot God burbling chaotically at the center of everything, surrounded by the thin monotonous piping of flutes.

### Ra
([overview](#overview))	

Every time someone mentions Harvard, or McKinsey, or even Google, I think of Sarah Constantin's [Ra](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/ra/). 

A quick sketch:

```markdown
The Egyptian god Ra was a symbol of divine kingship, all-powerful and all-seeing.  
He’s a good metaphor for a certain kind of psychological phenomenon that involves 
thought distortions around authority and legitimacy.

The Establishment is primarily an upper-class phenomenon, that it is more about 
social and moral legitimacy than mere wealth or raw power, and that it is *boringly
evil* — it produces respectable, normal, right-thinking, mild-mannered people who 
do things with very bad consequences.

It’s like a dissipating, entropic motion, a process that corrupts institutions.

Ra is something like a psychological mindset, that causes people to actually 
*seek* corruption and confusion, and to *prefer corruption for its own sake* — 
though, of course, it doesn’t feel quite like that from the inside.

Ra is a specific kind of glitch in intuition, which can roughly be summarized as 
*the drive to idealize vagueness and despise clarity*.  

As forces in the human psyche go, Ra is a pretty mild one. It’s not a powerful 
biological drive like aggression, or a difficult-to-treat problem like depression,
or a highly optimized energy-saving structure like the standard cognitive biases.

Ra is hard to pin down, but vulnerable to open communication and introspection.  
If you can talk and think about what you want, or how you feel, or why you believe
what you do, and you don’t dodge the question, Ra will dissolve like mist. 

Ra is hard to see, but easy to overcome once you see it.
```

What is Ra *not*?

```markdown
The usual pitfall when using poetic language to define egregores is making them too broad.
There is not one root of all evil that causes all the ills of the world.

Ra is not simply conformity, simply authoritarianism, or simply power-seeking.  Ra is not
the same as “bureaucracy” or “capitalism” or “fallen human nature” or all the myriad reasons
why your idealistic goal might fail.  Ra is not “everything that is wrong with people who
disagree with me.”

As a social phenomenon, Ra is responsible for some dysfunctions in the democratic modern 
West; it is not, for instance, what was going on with the Nazis, or with terrorists, or 
with communist revolutionaries, or with the Confederates in the American Civil War.  Ra 
is not driving people who want to take over the world for some fanatic goal. 

But it’s not *merely* the most commonly claimed drivers of institutional decay, like 
“knowledge problems” or “coordination problems”.  People who participate in those problems
*are* following rational self-interest, but wind up contributing individually to collectively
harmful outcomes.
```

Sarah goes on to define Ra extensionally. To summarize:

- Ra is about generic superlativity
- Ra is about legitimacy
- Ra defends itself with vagueness, confusion, incoherence — and then ange
- Ra hates communication and introspection
- Ra is fake Horus
- Ra corresponds to a stage in the corruption of organizations
- Ra is easy to overcome

I'll quote from the parts I liked:

### Legibility
([overview](#overview))	
	
The community forum *The Scholar's Stage* has a great post, [Tradition is Smarter Than You Are](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html), that gives a couple examples of tradition-as-Chesterton's-fence. It begins like so:

```markdown
Brain-power alone is not enough to explain why humans are such a successful species. Humans, he 
(evolutionary anthropologist-cum-cross cultural psychologist Joseph Henrich) argues, are not nearly
as intelligent as we think they are. Remove them from the culture and environment they have learned 
to operate in and they fail quickly. His favorite example of this are European explorers who die in
the middle of deserts, jungles, or arctic wastes even though thousands of generations of hunter-
gatherers were able to survive and thrive in these same environments. If human success was due to our
ability to problem solve, analyze, and rationally develop novel solutions to novel challenges, the 
explorers should have been fine. Their ghastly fates suggest that rationality may not be the key to
human survival.
```
 
The key is cultural evolution. An example via the cassava plant, or manioc, from Heinrich's book [*The Secret of Our Success*](https://amzn.to/2LuDcEh):

```markdown
In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties
for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for
example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping,
grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once
separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more
days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in
the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing. 

Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are 
difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have
a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of
view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever,
seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was
ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would
still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people
would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically 
boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. 
Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea,
stomach troubles, and vomiting). 

So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem
fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is
certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this
is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan
mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She 
might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that 
the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative 
procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with
a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier
protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years
or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning. 

Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier 
generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does
not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally
opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal
opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology. 

Wait. Maybe I’m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it’s actually rather easy to individually figure
out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the 
first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying
commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile 
or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations.
The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of
years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local 
preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low
levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven’t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places,
there’s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On 
the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, 
but these techniques are spreading only slowly.

The point here is that cultural evolution is often much smarter than we are. Operating over generations 
as individuals unconsciously attend to and learn from more successful, prestigious, and healthier members
of their communities, this evolutionary process generates cultural adaptations. Though these complex 
repertoires appear well designed to meet local challenges, they are not primarily the products of 
individuals applying causal models, rational thinking, or cost-benefit analyses. Often, most or all of
the people skilled in deploying such adaptive practices do not understand how or why they work, or even 
that they “do” anything at all. Such complex adaptations can emerge precisely because natural selection
has favored individuals who often place their faith in cultural inheritance—in the accumulated wisdom 
implicit in the practices and beliefs derived from their forbearers—over their own intuitions and 
personal experiences.
```

Another example from northern Canada, where Naskapi foragers hunt caribou:

```markdown
When hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might
lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou. 
However, this situation is like Matching Pennies in chapter 2. The caribou are mismatchers and the 
hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to 
mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous 
spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding
those locations (where they have previously seen humans). 

Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing. Can cultural evolution compensate for our 
cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and 
believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder
blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This 
patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking 
patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes 
depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these 
divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own
decision-making biases. The undergraduates in the Matching Pennies game could have used a randomizing 
device like divination, though the chimps seem fine without it.
```

There's a similar practice in Indonesia employed by the Kantus of Kalimantan, who use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots:

```markdown
The anthropologist Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements
that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler’s Fallacy and lead them to 
expect that floods will be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that 
location (which is not true). 

Second, as with the MBAs’ investment allocations in chapter 4, Kantus pay attention to others’ 
success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has
a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. 
Reducing the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, the Kantu rely on a system
of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them
avoid catastrophic crop failures. The results of divination depend not only on seeing a particular
bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call 
may be favorable, and another unfavorable). 

The patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems 
to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the seventeenth century when rice cultivation
was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by
randomizing garden locations. It’s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began
to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On average, over a lifetime, these
farmers would do better—be more successful—than farmers who relied on the Gambler’s Fallacy or on 
copying others’ immediate behavior. 

Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system had spread throughout the agricultural
populations of this Borneo region. Yet it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local
foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern 
Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions
where it is most adaptive. This example makes a key point: not only do people often not understand
what their cultural practices are doing, but sometimes it may even be important that they don’t
understand what their practices are doing or how they work. If people came to understand that bird 
augury or bone divination didn’t actually predict the future, the practice would probably be dropped
or people would increasingly ignore ritual findings in favor of their own intuitions.
```

There are two arguments Heinrich is making here:

```markdown
The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not
always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups 
whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions
stick around longest when they are adaptive. 

This process is "blind." Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases
(like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually
reduce the efficacy of the tradition. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot)
understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to
artificially create replacements. 
```

This, of course, jives perfectly with the work of James C. Scott. Here's *The Scholar's* summary intro:

```markdown
Scott has spent a large amount of his career studying the way states shape the societies they rule over, 
and the way societies try to resist the advance of the state. The central problem of ruler-ship, as Scott
sees it, is what he calls *legibility*. To extract resources from a population the state must be able to
understand that population. The state needs to make the people and things it rules legible to agents of
the government. Legibility means uniformity. States dream up uniform weights and measures, impress national
languages and ID numbers on their people, and divvy the country up into land plots and administrative 
districts, all to make the realm legible to the powers that be. 

The problem is that not all important things can be made legible. Much of what makes a society successful
is knowledge of the tacit sort: rarely articulated, messy, and from the outside looking in, purposeless. 
These are the first things lost in the quest for legibility. Traditions, small cultural differences, odd 
and distinctive lifeways—in other words, the products of cultural evolution that Henrich fills his book 
with—are all swept aside by a rationalizing state that preserves (or in many cases, imposes) only what it 
can be understood and manipulated from the 2,000 foot view. The result, as Scott chronicles with example
after example, are many of the greatest catastrophes of human history. 
```

That's a pretty good summary, but I prefer Scott Alexander's more verbose treatment in his [book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/) of James' book, because microhumor and just *likable* storytelling. 

Scott (SA, not JCS) begins with a suspicious observation:

```markdown
Scott starts with the story of “scientific forestry” in 18th century Prussia. Enlightenment
rationalists noticed that peasants were just cutting down whatever trees happened to grow in the
forests, *like a chump*. They came up with a better idea: clear all the forests and replace them 
by planting identical copies of Norway spruce (the highest-lumber-yield-per-unit-time tree) in 
an evenly-spaced rectangular grid. Then you could just walk in with an axe one day and chop down 
like a zillion trees an hour and have more timber than you could possibly ever want.

This went poorly. The impoverished ecosystem couldn’t support the game animals and medicinal 
herbs that sustained the surrounding peasant villages, and they suffered an economic collapse. 
The endless rows of identical trees were a perfect breeding ground for plant diseases and forest
fires. And the complex ecological processes that sustained the soil stopped working, so after a
generation the Norway spruces grew stunted and malnourished. Yet for some reason, everyone
involved got promoted, and “scientific forestry” spread across Europe and the world.
```

"Evenly-spaced rectangular grids" will become a suspiciously repeating theme, "not just in biological systems but also in social ones":

```markdown
Natural organically-evolved cities tend to be densely-packed mixtures of dark alleys, tiny 
shops, and overcrowded streets. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: 
an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of identical giant Brutalist apartment buildings separated 
by wide boulevards, with everything separated into carefully-zoned districts. Yet for some 
reason, whenever these new rational cities were built, people hated them and did everything 
they could to move out into more organic suburbs. And again, for some reason the urban
planners got promoted, became famous, and spread their destructive techniques around the world.

Ye olde organically-evolved peasant villages tended to be complicated confusions of everybody
trying to raise fifty different crops at the same time on awkwardly shaped cramped parcels of 
land. Modern scientific rationalists came up with a better idea: giant collective mechanized 
farms growing purpose-bred high-yield crops and arranged in (say it with me) evenly-spaced
rectangular grids. Yet for some reason, these giant collective farms had lower yields per acre
than the old traditional methods, and wherever they arose famine and mass starvation followed.
And again, for some reason governments continued to push the more “modern” methods, whether it
was socialist collectives in the USSR, big agricultural corporations in the US, or sprawling 
banana plantations in the Third World.

Traditional lifestyles of many East African natives were nomadic, involving slash-and-burn 
agriculture in complicated jungle terrain according to a bewildering variety of ad-hoc rules. 
Modern scientific rationalists in African governments (both colonial and independent) came up
with a better idea – resettlement of the natives into villages, where they could have modern 
amenities like schools, wells, electricity, and evenly-spaced rectangular grids. Yet for some
reason, these villages kept failing: their crops died, their economies collapsed, and their 
native inhabitants disappeared back into the jungle. And again, for some reason the African 
governments kept trying to bring the natives back and make them stay, even if they had to blur
the lines between villages and concentration camps to make it work.
```

This raises the question: why did these schemes fail, and why were they still continued despite that? James' two-part answer is High Modernism in service of (this is the key insight) *legibilization of the world by centralized governing bodies to aid monitoring and control*, mostly for efficient taxation:

```markdown
The first part of the story is High Modernism, an aesthetic taste masquerading as a scientific
philosophy. The High Modernists claimed to be about figuring out the most efficient and high-
tech way of doing things, but most of them knew little relevant math or science and were 
basically just LARPing being rational by placing things in evenly-spaced rectangular grids.

But the High Modernists were pawns in service of a deeper motive: the centralized state wanted
the world to be “legible”, ie arranged in a way that made it easy to monitor and control. An 
intact forest might be more productive than an evenly-spaced rectangular grid of Norway spruce,
but it was harder to legislate rules for, or assess taxes on.

The state promoted the High Modernists’ platitudes about The Greater Good as cover, in order to
implement the totalitarian schemes they wanted to implement anyway. The resulting experiments 
were usually failures by the humanitarian goals of the Modernists, but resounding successes by 
the command-and-control goals of the state. And so we gradually transitioned from systems that
were messy but full of fine-tuned hidden order, to ones that were barely-functional but really
easy to tax.
```

The problem that legibilization solves is best illustrated by a parable:

```markdown
Suppose you’re a premodern king, maybe one of the Louises who ruled France in the Middle Ages.
You want to tax people to raise money for a Crusade or something. Practically everyone in your 
kingdom is a peasant, and all the peasants produce is grain, so you’ll tax them in grain.
Shouldn’t be too hard, right? You’ll just measure how many pints of grain everyone produces, and…

	The pint in eighteenth-century Paris was equivalent to 0.93 liters, whereas in Seine-en-
	Montane it was 1.99 liters and in Precy-sous-Thil, an astounding 3.33 liters. The aune, 
	a measure of length used for cloth, varied depending on the material(the unit for silk, 
	for instance, was smaller than that for linen) and across France there were at least 
	seventeen different aunes.
	
Okay, this is stupid. Just give everybody evenly-sized baskets, and tell them that baskets are
the new unit of measurement.

	Virtually everywhere in early modern Europe were endless micropolitics about how baskets 
	might be adjusted through wear, bulging, tricks of weaving, moisture, the thickness of the
	rim, and so on. In some areas the local standards for the bushel and other units of
	measurement were kept in metallic form and placed in the care of a trusted official or else
	literally carved into the stone of a church or the town hall. Nor did it end there. How the
	grain was to be poured (from shoulder height, which packed it somewhat, or from waist height?),
	how damp it could be, whether the container could be shaken down, and finally, if and how it
	was to be leveled off when full were subjects of long and bitter controversy.
	
Huh, this medieval king business is harder than you thought. Maybe you can just leave this problem to 
the feudal lords?

	Thus far, this account of local measurement practices risks giving the impression that, 
	although local conceptions of distance, area, volume, and so on were different from and
	more varied than the unitary abstract standards a state might favor, they were nevertheless
	aiming at objective accuracy. This impression would be false. […]

	A good part of the politics of measurement sprang from what a contemporary economist might 
	call the “stickiness” of feudal rents. Noble and clerical claimants often found it difficult
	to 	increase feudal dues directly; the levels set for various charges were the result of
	long struggle, and even a small increase above the customary level was viewed as a threatening
	breach of tradition. Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of achieving
	the same end.

	The local lord might, for example, lend grain to peasants in smaller baskets and insist on 
	repayment in larger baskets. He might surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the
	grain sacks accepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of the
	sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in larger baskets and
	pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal custom governing feudal dues and wages 
	would thus remain intact (requiring, for example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the
	harvest of a given holding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord. The
	results of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size of the bushel
	(boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille) increased by one-third between 1674
	and 1716 as part of what was called the reaction feodale.
	
Okay, but nobody’s going to make too big a deal about this, right?

	This sense of victimization [over changing units of measure] was evident in the cahiers of 
	grievances prepared for the meeting of the Estates General just before the Revolution. […]
	In an unprecedented revolutionary context where an entirely new political system was being
	created from first principles, it was surely no great matter to legislate uniform weights 
	and measures. As the revolutionary decree read “The centuries old dream of the masses of
	only one just measure has come true! The Revolution has given the people the meter!”	
	
Maybe you should tax land. After all, it’s the land that grows the grain. Just figure out how much
land everybody owns, and you can calculate some kind of appropriate tax from there.

So, uh, peasant villagers, how much land does each of you own?

	A hypothetical case of customary land tenure practices may help demonstrate how difficult
	it is to assimilate such practices to the barebones scheme of a modern cadastral map 
	[land survey suitable for tax assessment][…]

	Let us imagine a community in which families have usufruct rights to parcels of cropland
	during the main growing season. Only certain crops, however, may be planted, and every 
	seven years the usufruct land is distributed among resident families according to each 
	family’s size and its number of able-bodied adults. After the harvest of the main-season
	crop, all cropland reverts to common land where any family may glean, graze their fowl and
	livestock, and even plant quickly maturing, dry-season crops. Rights to graze fowl and
	livestock on pasture-land held in common by the village is extended to all local families, 
	but the number of animals that can be grazed is restricted according to family size, 
	especially in dry years when forage is scarce. Families not using their grazing rights can
	give them to other villagers but not to outsiders. Everyone has the right to gather 
	firewood for normal family needs, and the village blacksmith and baker are given larger
	allotments. No commercial sale from village woodlands is permitted.

	Trees that have been planted and any fruit they may bear are the property of the family 
	who planted them, no matter where they are now growing. Fruit fallen from such tree, however,
	is the property of anyone who gathers it. When a family fells one of its trees or a tree is
	felled by a storm, the trunk belongs to the family, the branches to the immediate neighbors, 
	and the “tops” (leaves and twigs) to any poorer villager who carries them off. Land is set
	aside for use or leasing out by widows with children and dependents of conscripted males.
	Usufruct rights to land and trees may be let to anyone in the village; the only time they
	may be let to someone outside the village is if no one in the community wishes to claim 
	them. After a crop failure leading to a food shortage, many of these arrangements are
	readjusted.

You know what? I’m just going to put you all down as owning ten. Ten land. Everyone okay with that?
Cool. Let’s say ten land for everyone and just move on to the next village.

	Novoselok village had a varied economy of cultivation, grazing, and forestry…the complex
	welter of strips was designed to ensure that each village household received a strip of 
	land in every ecological zone. An individual household might have as many as ten to 
	fifteen different plots constituting something of a representative sample of the village’s
	ecological zones and microclimates. The distribution spread a family’s risks prudently, 
	and from time to time the land was reshuffled as families grew or shrunk…The strips of
	land were generally straight and parallel so that a readjustment could be made by moving
	small stakes along just one side of a field, without having to think of areal dimensions.
	Where the other side of the field was not parallel, the stakes could be shifted to 
	compensate for the fact that the strip lay toward the narrower or wider end of the field.
	Irregular fields were divided, not according to area, but according to yield.

…huh. Maybe this isn’t going to work. Let’s try it the other way around. Instead of mapping land,
we can just get a list with the name of everyone in the village, and go from there.

	Only wealthy aristocrats tended to have fixed surnames…Imagine the dilemma of a tithe or
	capitation-tax collector [in England] faced with a male population, 90% of whom bore just
	six Christian names (John, William, Thomas, Robert, Richard, and Henry).

Okay, fine. That won’t work either. Surely there’s something else we can do to assess a tax burden
on each estate. Think outside the box, scrape the bottom of the barrel!

	The door-and-window tax established in France [in the 18th century] is a striking case in 
	point. Its originator must have reasoned that the number of windows and doors in a dwelling
	was proportional to the dwelling’s size. Thus a tax assessor need not enter the house or 
	measure it, but merely count the doors and windows.

	As a simple, workable formula, it was a brilliant stroke, but it was not without consequences.
	Peasant dwellings were subsequently designed or renovated with the formula in mind so as to
	have as few openings as possible. While the fiscal losses could be recouped by raising the tax
	per opening, the long-term effects on the health of the population lasted for more than a century.	
```

Notice that this is totally in keeping with [reality having a surprising amount of detail](#Reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), but on top of that there's all this adversarial stuff going on -- feudal rent-seeking and its avoidance, fairness, politicization of measurement, etc.  

Another issue is that the relative illegibility of early cities to outsides granted locals a vital margin of political safety from outside control, as can be illustrated by the simple heuristic of asking if an outsider needed a local guide to navigate; centralized states didn't like this:

```markdown
Historically, the relative illegibility to outsiders of some urban neighborhoods has provided a 
vital margin of political safety from control by outside elites. A simple way of determining whether
this margin exists is to ask if an outsider would have needed a local guide in order to find her way 
successfully. If the answer is yes, then the community or terrain in question enjoys at least a small
measure of insulation from outside intrusion. Coupled with patterns of local solidarity, this 
insulation has proven politically valuable in such disparate contexts as eighteenth-and early 
nineteenth-century urban riots over bread prices in Europe, the Front de Liberation Nationale’s 
tenacious resistance to the French in the Casbah of Algiers, and the politics of the bazaar that 
helped to bring down the Shah of Iran. Illegibility, then, has been and remains a reliable resource
for political autonomy.
```

Anyway, *that's* what legibilization solves:

```markdown
The moral of the story is: premodern states had very limited ability to tax their citizens 
effectively. Along with the problems mentioned above – nonstandardized measurement, 
nonstandardized property rights, nonstandardized personal names – we can add a few others. 
At this point national languages were a cruel fiction; local “dialects” could be as different
from one another as eg Spanish is from Portuguese, so villagers might not even be able to
understand the tax collectors. Worst of all, there was no such thing as a census in France
until the 17th century, so there wasn’t even a good idea of how many people or villages there
were.

Kings usually solved this problem by leaving the tax collection up to local lords, who 
presumably knew the idiosyncracies of their own domains. But one step wasn’t always enough. 
If the King only knew Dukes, and the Dukes only knew Barons, and the Barons only knew village
headmen, and it was only the village headmen who actually knew anything about the peasants, 
then you needed a four-step chain to get any taxes. Each link in the chain had an incentive to
collect as much as they could and give up as little as they could get away with. So on the one
end, the peasants were paying backbreaking punitive taxes. And on the other, the Royal Treasurer
was handing the King half a loaf of moldy bread and saying “Here you go, Sire, apparently this 
is all the grain in France.”

So from the beginning, kings had an incentive to make the country “legible” – that is, so
organized and well-indexed that it was easy to know everything about everyone and collect/double-
check taxes. Also from the beginning, nobles had an incentive to frustrate the kings so that they
wouldn’t be out of a job. And commoners, who figured that anything which made it easier for the 
State to tax them and interfere in their affairs was bad news, usually resisted too.
```

Resistance against legibilization was intense, but centralized states gradually pushed outwards from their capitals iteratively, honing their techniques as they went. Here's what happened in the context of surnames:

```markdown
Peasants didn’t like permanent surnames. Their own system was quite reasonable for them: John the
baker was John Baker, John the blacksmith was John Smith, John who lived under the hill was John 
Underhill, John who was really short was John Short. The same person might be John Smith and John
Underhill in different contexts, where his status as a blacksmith or place of origin was more 
important.

But the government insisted on giving everyone a single permanent name, unique for the village, and 
tracking who was in the same family as whom. Resistance was intense:

	What evidence we have suggests that second names of any kind became rare as distance from the state’s
	fiscal reach increased. Whereas one-third of the households in Florence declared a second name, the
	proportion dropped to one-fifth for secondary towns and to one-tenth in the countryside. It was not
	until the seventeenth century that family names crystallized in the most remote and poorest areas of
	Tuscany – the areas that would have had the least contact with officialdom. […]

	State naming practices, like state mapping practices, were inevitably associated with taxes (labor,
	military service, grain, revenue) and hence aroused popular resistance. The great English peasant 
	rising of 1381 (often called the Wat Tyler Rebellion) is attributed to an unprecedented decade of
	registration and assessments of poll taxes. For English as well as for Tuscan peasants, a census of
	all adult males could not but appear ominous, if not ruinous.

The same issues repeated themselves a few hundred years later when Europe started colonizing other
continents. Again they encountered a population with naming systems they found unclear and unsuitable 
to taxation. But since colonial states had more control over their subjects than the relatively weak
feudal monarchies of the Middle Ages, they were able to deal with it in one fell swoop, sometimes
comically so:

Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the Philippines under the Spanish. Filipinos were instructed
by the decree of November 21, 1849 to take on permanent Hispanic surnames. […]

	Each local official was to be given a supply of surnames sufficient for his jurisdiction, “taking
	care that the distribution be made by letters of the alphabet.” In practice, each town was given
	a number of pages from the alphabetized [catalog], producing whole towns with surnames beginning
	with the same letter. In situations where there has been little in-migration in the past 150 years,
	the traces of this administrative exercise are still perfectly visible across the landscape. “For
	example, in the Bikol region, the entire alphabet is laid out like a garland over the provinces of
	Albay, Sorsogon, and Catanduanes which in 1849 belonged to the single jurisdiction of Albay. 
	Beginning with A at the provincial capital, the letters B and C mark the towns along the cost 
	beyond Tabaco to Wiki. We return and trace along the coast of Sorosgon the letters E to L, then 
	starting down the Iraya Valley at Daraga with M, we stop with S to Polangui and Libon, and finish
	the alphabet with a quick tour around the island of Catanduas.

	The confusion for which the decree is the antidote is largely that of the administrator and the tax
	collector. Universal last names, they believe, will facilitate the administration of justice, finance,
	and public order as well as make it simpler for prospective marriage partners to calculate their 
	degree of consanguinity. For a utilitarian state builder of [Governor] Claveria’s temper, however, the 
	ultimate goal was a complete and legible list of subjects and taxpayers.

This was actually a lot less cute and funny than the alphabetization makes it sound:

	What if the Filipinos chose to ignore their new last names? This possibility had already crossed 
	Claveria’s mind, and he took steps to make sure that the names would stick. Schoolteachers were
	ordered to forbid their students to address or even know one another by any name except the officially
	inscribed family name. Those teachers who did not apply the rule with enthusiasm were to be punished.
	More efficacious perhaps, given the minuscule school enrollment, was the proviso that forbade priests 
	and military and civil officials from accepting any document, application, petition, or deed that did 
	not use the official surnames. All documents using other names would be null and void.

Similar provisions ensured the replacement of local dialects with the approved national language. Students
were only allowed to learn the national language in school and were punished for speaking in vernacular. 
All formal documents had to be in the national language, which meant that peasants who had formally been 
able to manage their own legal affairs had to rely on national-language-speaking intermediaries. Scott
talks about the effect in France:

	One can hardly imagine a more effective formula for immediately devaluing local knowledge and 
	privileging all those who had mastered the official linguistic code. It was a gigantic shift in power.
	Those at the periphery who lacked competence in French were rendered mute and marginal. They were now 
	in need of a local guide to the new state culture, which appeared in the form of lawyers, notaries, 
	schoolteachers, clerks, and soldiers.

James' description of why Brasilia was abandoned reminds me of Putrajaya, except for the latter they perhaps tried to do a hybrid of sorts to learn from the mistakes of the "Corbusierites":

```markdown
Most of those who have moved to Brasilia from other cities are amazed to discover “that it is a 
city without crowds.” People complain that Brasilia lacks the bustle of street life, that it has 
none of the busy street corners and long stretches of storefront facades that animate a sidewalk
for pedestrians. For them, it is almost as if the founders of Brasilia, rather than having planned
a city, have actually planned to prevent a city. The most common way they put it is to say that
Brasilia “lacks street corners,”by which they mean that it lacks the complex intersections of dense
neighborhoods comprising residences and public cafes and restaurants with places for leisure, work,
and shopping.

While Brasilia provides well for some human needs, the functional separation of work from residence
and of both from commerce and entertainment, the great voids between superquadra, and a road system
devoted exclusively to motorized traffic make the disappearance of the street corner a foregone
conclusion. The plan did eliminate traffic jams; it also eliminated the welcome and familiar 
pedestrian jams that one of Holston’s informants called "the point of social conviviality".

The term brasilite, meaning roughly Brasilia-itis,which was coined by the first-generation residents,
nicely captures the trauma they experienced. As a mock clinical condition, it connotes a rejection of
the standardization and anonymity of life in Brasilia. “They use the term brasilite to refer to their
feelings about a daily life without the pleasures-the distractions, conversations, flirtations, and
little rituals of outdoor life in other Brazilian cities.” Meeting someone normally requires seeing
them either at their apartment or at work. Even if we allow for the initial simplifying premise of 
Brasilia’s being an administrative city, there is nonetheless a bland anonymity built into the very 
structure of the capital. The population simply lacks the small accessible spaces that they could
colonize and stamp with the character of their activity, as they have done historically in Rio and
Sao Paulo. To be sure, the inhabitants of Brasilia haven’t had much time to modify the city through 
their practices, but the city is designed to be fairly recalcitrant to their efforts.

“Brasilite,” as a term, also underscores how the built environment affects those who dwell in it. 
Compared to life in Rio and Sao Paulo, with their color and variety, the daily round in bland,
repetitive, austere Brasilia must have resembled life in a sensory deprivation tank. The recipe for 
high-modernist urban planning, while it may have created formal order and functional segregation, did
so at the cost of a sensorily impoverished and monotonous environment-an environment that inevitably
took its toll on the spirits of its residents.

The anonymity induced by Brasilia is evident from the scale and exterior of the apartments that 
typically make up each residential superquadra. For superquadra residents, the two most frequent 
complaints are the sameness of the apartment blocks and the isolation of the residences (“In Brasilia,
there is only house and work”). The facade of each block is strictly geometric and egalitarian.
Nothing distinguishes the exterior of one apartment from another; there are not even balconies that 
would allow residents to add distinctive touches and create semipublic spaces.
```

It's useful to contrast High Modernist principles (as epitomized by the French architech Le Corbusier) with Jane Jacobs' critique of them. 

High Modernism:

```markdown
First, there can be no compromise with the existing infrastructure. It was designed by superstitious
people who didn’t have architecture degrees, or at the very least got their architecture degrees in
the past and so were insufficiently Modern. The more completely it is bulldozed to make way for the
Glorious Future, the better.

Second, human needs can be abstracted and calculated. A human needs X amount of food. A human needs 
X amount of water. A human needs X amount of light, and prefers to travel at X speed, and wants to 
live within X miles of the workplace. These needs are easily calculable by experiment, and a good 
city is the one built to satisfy these needs and ignore any competing frivolities.

Third, the solution is the solution. It is universal. The rational design for Moscow is the same as
the rational design for Paris is the same as the rational design for Chandigarh, India. As a 
corollary, all of these cities ought to look exactly the same. It is maybe permissible to adjust for
obstacles like mountains or lakes. But only if you are on too short a budget to follow the rationally
correct solution of leveling the mountain and draining the lake to make your city truly optimal.

Fourth, all of the relevant rules should be explicitly determined by technocrats, then followed to the
letter by their subordinates. Following these rules is better than trying to use your intuition, in 
the same way that using the laws of physics to calculate the heat from burning something is better than
just trying to guess, or following an evidence-based clinical algorithm is better than just prescribing
whatever you feel like.

Fifth, there is nothing whatsoever to be gained or learned from the people involved (eg the city’s 
future citizens). You are a rational modern scientist with an architecture degree who has already 
calculated out the precise value for all relevant urban parameters. They are yokels who probably cannot
even spell the word architecture, let alone usefully contribute to it. They probably make all of their
decisions based on superstition or tradition or something, and their input should be ignored For Their
Own Good.
```

Jane Jacobs' critique of them, as summarized twice over by James and Scott:

```markdown
First, existing structures are evolved organisms built by people trying to satisfy their social
goals. They contain far more wisdom about people’s needs and desires than anybody could formally
enumerate. Any attempt at urban planning should try to build on this encoded knowledge, not 
detract from it.

Second, man does not live by bread alone. People don’t want the right amount of Standardized Food
Product, they want social interaction, culture, art, coziness, and a host of other things nobody 
will ever be able to calculate. Existing structures have already been optimized for these things,
and unless you’re really sure you understand all of them, you should be reluctant to disturb them.

Third, solutions are local. Americans want different things than Africans or Indians. One proof of
this is that New York looks different from Lagos and from Delhi. Even if you are the world’s best 
American city planner, you should be very concerned that you have no idea what people in Africa 
need, and you should be very reluctant to design an African city without extensive consultation of
people who understand the local environment.

Fourth, even a very smart and well-intentioned person who is on board with points 1-3 will never be
able to produce a set of rules. Most of people’s knowledge is implicit, and most rule codes are 
quickly replaced by informal systems of things that work which are much more effective (the classic 
example of this is work-to-rule strikes).

Fifth, although well-educated technocrats may understand principles which give them some advantages
in their domain, they are hopeless without the on-the-ground experience of the people they are trying
to serve, whose years of living in their environment and dealing with it every day have given them a
deep practical knowledge which is difficult to codify.

To the Tukanoans' multistep manioc/cassava processing, the Naskapi foragers' randomized caribou-hunting and Kantus' bird augury for agricultural plot location selection at the beginning of this section James adds the example of Tanzanian farming:

```markdown
(In Tanzania), small farmers grew dozens of different crops together in seeming chaos. Western 
colonists tried to convince them – often by force – to switch to just growing one thing at a time 
to reap advantages of efficiency, standardization, and specialization of labor. Only growing one 
crop in the same field was Agricultural Science 101. But this turned out to be a bad idea in the 
difficult Tanzanian environment:

	The multistoried effect of polyculture has some distinct advantages for yields and soil 
	conservation. “Upper-story” crops shade “lowerstory” crops, which are selected for their
	ability to thrive in the cooler soil temperature and increased humidity at ground level.
	Rainfall reaches the ground not directly but as a fine spray that is absorbed with less
	damage to soil structure and less erosion. The taller crops often serve as a useful 
	windbreak for the lower crops. Finally, in mixed or relay cropping, a crop is in the field
	at all times, holding the soil together and reducing the leaching effects that sun, wind,
	and rain exert, particularly on fragile land. Even if polyculture is not to be preferred
	on the grounds of immediate yield, there is much to recommend it in terms of sustainability
	and thus long-term production.

	Our discussion of mixed cropping has thus far dealt only with the narrow issues of yield 
	and soil conservation. It has overlooked the cultivators themselves and the various other
	ends that they seek by using such techniques. The most significant advantage of 
	intercropping, Paul Richards claims, is its great flexibility, “the scope [it] offers for
	a range of combinations to match individual needs and preferences, local conditions, and 
	changing circumstances within each season and from season to season.” Farmers may polycrop 
	in order to avoid labor bottlenecks at planting and at harvest.44Growing many different 
	crops is also an obvious way to spread risks and improve food security. Cultivators can
	reduce the danger of going hungry if they sow, instead of only one or two cultivars, crops
	of long and short maturity, crops that are drought resistant and those that do well under
	wetter conditions, crops with different patterns of resistance to pests and diseases, crops
	that can be stored in the ground with little loss (such as cassava), and crops that mature 
	in the “hungry time” before other crops are gathered. Finally, and perhaps most important, 
	each of these crops is embedded in a distinctive set of social relations. Different members
	of the household are likely to have different rights and responsibilities with respect to
	each crop. The planting regimen, in other words, is a reflection of social relations, ritual
	needs, and culinary tastes; it is not just a production strategy that a profit-maximizing 
	entrepreneur took straight out of the pages of a text in neoclassical economics.
```

Okay. After all this talk negatively portraying legibility, is it *bad* somehow? James says that's not what he was getting at:

```markdown
...he’s not against legibility and modernism per se, but he wants to present them as ingredients
in a cocktail of state failure. You need a combination of four things to get a disaster like Soviet
collective farming (or his other favorite example, compulsory village settlement in Tanzania). 
First, a government incentivized to seek greater legibility for its population and territory. 
Second, a High Modernist ideology. Third, authoritarianism. And fourth, a “prostrate civil society”,
like in Russia after the Revolution, or in colonies after the Europeans took over.

I think his theory is that the back-and-forth between centralized government and civil society allows
scientific advances to be implemented smoothly instead of just plowing over everyone in a way that 
leads to disaster. I also think that maybe a big part of it is incremental versus sudden: western 
farming did well because it got to incrementally add advances and see how they worked, but when you
threw the entire edifice at Tanzania it crashed and burned.
```
