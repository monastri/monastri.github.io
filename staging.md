## Opinions on hiking
([overview](#overview))

Spencer Greenberg has a [list of psychological gulfs](https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103598358776962), common differences between people that are so large that those at the opposite extreme ends of the trait (say, the 5th percentile vs. 95th percentile) have a very hard time understanding and relating to each other -- note that each of these examples is supposed to illustrate a somewhat extreme form of each trait for clarity purposes; most people who have or lack each trait don’t have a form that is as extreme as is shown in these examples.

Extraversion vs. Introversion:

```markdown
“Are you coming out? It’s going to be a HUGE night! First we’re meeting up with 
Bill, Harry and Jennifer for drinks. Then stopping by the party to see the whole
crew, and after, if we’re feeling it, we’ll hit up Sing Song karaoke. Then we’re
hitting the clubs for the rest of the night!”

“Thanks…I appreciate the invite. I’m just going to stay in tonight though. I’ve 
really been loving this book I’m reading. All week I’ve been looking forward to 
having the time to finish it.”
```

Conscientiousness vs. Easy goingness:

```markdown
“I can’t believe how much material this exam is going to cover! I still need to 
make an outline of all the material, and flashcards. Last time I color coded my 
outline which worked really well, though it took a long time to make. I might 
borrow outlines from a couple other people to see how they organize the material. 
I’m going to be up until 2am tonight at least.”

“Me too…but more like 4am. I have a date with World of Warcraft. You do realize
this test only counts for 5% of our grade, right? I might just skip the exam
actually.”
```

Social awareness vs. Social unawareness:

```markdown
“Let’s go talk to Sally over there, she clearly wants to get out of that 
conversation with Bill. Plus, I should introduce her to Ethan.”

“Wait, who’s Sally again…is she one of the new engineers? How do you know she 
doesn’t like Bill, did she tell you that? And is Ethan even here tonight??? Why 
do you want to introduce them to each other anyway?”
```

Emotionality vs. Stability:

```markdown
“Sometimes life is so intense that I almost can’t take it. I’ll just burst out 
in tears in the middle of the day and have to hide in the bathroom at work. I 
wouldn’t have it any other way though, it’s what makes life so meaningful.”

“Crying at work you mean? I’ve done that too actually. I was at work when I found
out my sister had died. It was really tough. Actually though, now that I think 
about it, I finished out my shift since I only had 5 minutes of it left anyway.
And I don’t think I cried until later that night when I was at home alone.”
```

Aesthetic sensitivity vs. Aesthetic indifference:

```markdown
“Did you see the colors he painted his walls??? They made my skin crawl.”

“Wait, what color were they? And how is it even possible for colors to make your
skin crawl???”
```

Empathy vs. Unsympatheticness:

```markdown
“Please, please don’t use glue traps. Once the mouse is stuck it will slowly starve
to death. What if I help you trap it and then we can find a good place to release 
it outside?”

“Are you kidding me? We’re talking about a mouse! If the stupid thing weren’t so 
damn fast I’d just stamp right on its head with my boots, that would take so much
less time.”
```

Anxiety vs. Calmness:

```markdown
“I’ve been worried all day because I’ve been waiting for the doctor to call me
with my test results. I mean, I know I probably will test negative, but what if
I don’t? I wouldn’t be able to stay in school anymore, and I’m not sure I could
afford the medical bills. Even if there is a 1% that I test positive, the
consequences would just be so serious that it’s still a big deal. And my chances
might even be worse than 1%! I really don’t need this right now, I was already
really worried about the presentation I have to give to the CEO at the end of the
month. What is life going to throw at me next?”

“Honestly, you just need to relax. What’s the point of worrying about all this?
Worrying doesn’t change anything and you’re just stressing yourself out. Like 
you said, you're really unlikely to test positive. Everything is going to be
totally fine in the end."
```

Openness vs. Closedness:

```markdown
“That was the coolest lecture ever, I’m so inspired right now. I can only BEGIN 
to imagine what it’s like to be Prism, as a visually impaired Chinese Italian non
gender binary person who has spent fifteen years fighting for the medical 
establishment to finally recognize the alternative medical treatments that cured
his own cancer! Prism has so many interesting ideas about relationships and child
rearing too. I’m also really excited now to buy a few books on the diversity of 
social practices among First Nations people.”

“Seriously, you enjoyed that??? That was literally the weirdest thing I’ve ever 
experienced. I wanted to puke when he made us all put our arms around each other 
in a circle and try to open our ‘inner eye’. What does that even mean??? Not to
mention that half the people there were out of it on drugs of some kind. And why
on earth was that woman practically naked?”
```

Authoritarianism vs. Libertarianism:

```markdown
“If your father wants you to move in with him and your mom, then that’s your duty 
as their child. Maybe your pastor can give you advice for how to make it a smooth 
transition.”

“It was my parents choice to have me. Just because they made that choice doesn’t 
mean they have control over my life. Are you serious that if you were me you would
talk to a pastor for advice? Sure, I’m spiritual. But I don’t belong to a church 
or follow one particular set of teachings, I prefer to figure out myself what 
religion and spirituality mean.”
```

Jess Riedel suggests "individualism vs collectivism" might be a better way to carve *individual* psychology at the joints:

```markdown
There seems to a huge difference between folks who see the world in terms of 
interacting individual humans vs. interacting groups of humans (or memes/concepts
that propagate within groups), where the groups are said to be effectively
irreducible for the purpose of useful analysis.
```

Optimism vs. Pessimism:

```markdown
“I can’t wait until vacation! We’re going to have such an incredible time together. 
And it’s going to be such a well deserved break after all this hard work. Plus, 
they’re going to announce bonuses right before we leave. Business has been great,
I bet they’ll be the biggest bonuses yet. When we’re lying on the beach we can 
discuss the fun things we’re going to buy with all that money!”

“Vacation will be pretty fun I guess. But I’ve been thinking…the beaches get so
crowded during the vacation season, maybe it would make more sense to just stay 
home this year. It’s pretty pointless just lying on the beach all day anyway. I 
know you’re excited about bonuses, but I don’t want you to get your hopes up. 
Business looked good this year, but our industry is about to get squeezed with 
all the new technology coming to market. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t 
even give us bonuses. After all, we work at a company that tries to convince 
consumers to buy meaningless shit they don’t need, so why would the company care
about making its employees happy?”
```

Sexuality vs. Asexuality:

```markdown
“This club is amazing…it has the hottest people I’ve ever seen! I would literally
sleep with anyone here. It’s hard to even focus on this conversation!”

“Oh…hmm, I guess you’re right, there are a lot of good looking people here. All
the skin tight clothing and showing off of skin seems a bit gratuitous though, 
don’t you think?”
```

Analyticalness vs. Intuitiveness:

```markdown
“I’ve been thinking about social interaction a lot lately, and currently my best
framework for how to start a conversation with a stranger is to make a comment 
about something in the surrounding context that you know the other person is 
already aware of. For instance, about the weather, but only if the weather is well
above or below average for that season. Then, once the other person responds to
your comment, you should ask them a question related to their response to get them
talking further. If the person gives a really short response to your question then
it probably means…”

“Can I stop you right there? Honestly, if you’re analyzing how to have social 
interaction you’re already doing it wrong. Just get a feel for what the other person
is like. Then just say whatever feels most natural to say. Don’t overthink everything!”
```

Self admiration vs. Self doubt:

```markdown
“There are very few incredible people in the world. What are the chances that two truly
unique and awesome people would find each other? It’s one in a million. You’re
unbelievably special, and it couldn’t be more obvious that we’re meant to be together. 
I think that as a team we could achieve just about anything.”

“You keep calling me special, but honestly, I’m embarrassed to admit it, but there’s
nothing special about me. Nearly everything I’ve achieved was just a result of good 
luck, or having unfair opportunities that other people don’t get, and I’m probably one
of the least talented people to achieve what I’ve achieved. Eventually people will
figure that out about me and it will all come crashing down. And when I get good 
opportunities I usually just mess them up or undermine myself. If there’s anything 
special about me, it’s that there’s something wrong with me. I screw things up. 
Fundamentally, not only am I ordinary, but I’m not even an especially good person, and
I don’t deserve much of anything.”
```

Jess Riedel adds "the degree to which the person thinks in terms of normative vs. positive statements":

```markdown
I have been surprised at how difficult it is for me to communicate with folks 
who, by my lights, are unable to discuss a topic without framing it in terms of
value judgements.
```
