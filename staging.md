The community forum *The Scholar's Stage* has a great post, [Tradition is Smarter Than You Are](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html), that gives a couple examples of tradition-as-Chesterton's-fence. It begins like so:

```markdown
Brain-power alone is not enough to explain why humans are such a successful species. Humans, he 
(evolutionary anthropologist-cum-cross cultural psychologist Joseph Henrich) argues, are not nearly
as intelligent as we think they are. Remove them from the culture and environment they have learned 
to operate in and they fail quickly. His favorite example of this are European explorers who die in
the middle of deserts, jungles, or arctic wastes even though thousands of generations of hunter-
gatherers were able to survive and thrive in these same environments. If human success was due to our
ability to problem solve, analyze, and rationally develop novel solutions to novel challenges, the 
explorers should have been fine. Their ghastly fates suggest that rationality may not be the key to
human survival.
```

The key is cultural evolution. An example via the cassava plant, or manioc, from Heinrich's book [*The Secret of Our Success*](https://amzn.to/2LuDcEh):

```markdown
In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties
for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for
example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping,
grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once
separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more
days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in
the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing. 

Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are 
difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have
a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of
view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever,
seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was
ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would
still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people
would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically 
boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. 
Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea,
stomach troubles, and vomiting). 

So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem
fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is
certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this
is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan
mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She 
might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that 
the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative 
procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with
a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier
protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years
or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning. 

Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier 
generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does
not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally
opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal
opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology. 

Wait. Maybe I’m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it’s actually rather easy to individually figure
out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the 
first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying
commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile 
or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations.
The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of
years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local 
preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low
levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven’t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places,
there’s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On 
the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, 
but these techniques are spreading only slowly.

The point here is that cultural evolution is often much smarter than we are. Operating over generations 
as individuals unconsciously attend to and learn from more successful, prestigious, and healthier members
of their communities, this evolutionary process generates cultural adaptations. Though these complex 
repertoires appear well designed to meet local challenges, they are not primarily the products of 
individuals applying causal models, rational thinking, or cost-benefit analyses. Often, most or all of
the people skilled in deploying such adaptive practices do not understand how or why they work, or even 
that they “do” anything at all. Such complex adaptations can emerge precisely because natural selection
has favored individuals who often place their faith in cultural inheritance—in the accumulated wisdom 
implicit in the practices and beliefs derived from their forbearers—over their own intuitions and 
personal experiences.

Another example from northern Canada, where Naskapi foragers hunt caribou:

```markdown
When hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might
lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou. 
However, this situation is like Matching Pennies in chapter 2. The caribou are mismatchers and the 
hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to 
mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous 
spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding
those locations (where they have previously seen humans). 

Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing. Can cultural evolution compensate for our 
cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and 
believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder
blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This 
patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking 
patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes 
depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these 
divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own
decision-making biases. The undergraduates in the Matching Pennies game could have used a randomizing 
device like divination, though the chimps seem fine without it.
```

There's a similar practice in Indonesia employed by the Kantus of Kalimantan, who use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots:

```markdown
The anthropologist Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements
that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler’s Fallacy and lead them to 
expect that floods will be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that 
location (which is not true). 

Second, as with the MBAs’ investment allocations in chapter 4, Kantus pay attention to others’ 
success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has
a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. 
Reducing the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, the Kantu rely on a system
of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them
avoid catastrophic crop failures. The results of divination depend not only on seeing a particular
bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call 
may be favorable, and another unfavorable). 

The patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems 
to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the seventeenth century when rice cultivation
was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by
randomizing garden locations. It’s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began
to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On average, over a lifetime, these
farmers would do better—be more successful—than farmers who relied on the Gambler’s Fallacy or on 
copying others’ immediate behavior. 

Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system had spread throughout the agricultural
populations of this Borneo region. Yet it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local
foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern 
Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions
where it is most adaptive. This example makes a key point: not only do people often not understand
what their cultural practices are doing, but sometimes it may even be important that they don’t
understand what their practices are doing or how they work. If people came to understand that bird 
augury or bone divination didn’t actually predict the future, the practice would probably be dropped
or people would increasingly ignore ritual findings in favor of their own intuitions.

There are two arguments Heinrich is making here:

```markdown
The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not
always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups 
whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions
stick around longest when they are adaptive. 

This process is "blind." Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases
(like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually
reduce the efficacy of the tradition. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot)
understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to
artificially create replacements. 
```

This, of course, jives perfectly with the work of James C. Scott. Here's *The Scholar's* summary intro:

```markdown
Scott has spent a large amount of his career studying the way states shape the societies they rule over, 
and the way societies try to resist the advance of the state. The central problem of ruler-ship, as Scott
sees it, is what he calls *legibility*. To extract resources from a population the state must be able to
understand that population. The state needs to make the people and things it rules legible to agents of
the government. Legibility means uniformity. States dream up uniform weights and measures, impress national
languages and ID numbers on their people, and divvy the country up into land plots and administrative 
districts, all to make the realm legible to the powers that be. 

The problem is that not all important things can be made legible. Much of what makes a society successful
is knowledge of the tacit sort: rarely articulated, messy, and from the outside looking in, purposeless. 
These are the first things lost in the quest for legibility. Traditions, small cultural differences, odd 
and distinctive lifeways—in other words, the products of cultural evolution that Henrich fills his book 
with—are all swept aside by a rationalizing state that preserves (or in many cases, imposes) only what it 
can be understood and manipulated from the 2,000 foot view. The result, as Scott chronicles with example
after example, are many of the greatest catastrophes of human history. 
```

That's a pretty good summary, but I prefer Scott Alexander's more verbose treatment in his [book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/) of James' book. 

Scott (SA, not JCS) begins with a suspicious observation:
