## What is this?

This is the "artificial intelligence and biology" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Why we are trichromats
([overview](#overview))

Why are we trichromats, and not (say) tetrachromats like mantis shrimp? I honestly thought this was one of those unanswerable anthropic-style questions, so it was pretty surprising to find a naturalistic non-anthropic-flavored explanation. This quote comes from Eliezer Yudkowsky's paper [LOGI](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf):

```markdown
Among other questions, Roger Shepard’s truly elegant paper “The Perceptual Organization of Colors” seeks to answer 
the question of trichromancy: Why are there three kinds of cones in the human retina, and not two, or four? Why is 
human visual perception organized into a three-dimensional color space? Historically, it was often theorized that 
trichromancy represented an arbitrary compromise between chromatic resolution and spatial resolution; that is, 
between the number of colors perceived and the grain size of visual resolution. As it turns out, there is a more 
fundamental reason why three color channels are needed.

To clarify the question, consider that surfaces possess a potentially infinite number of spectral reflectance 
distributions. We will focus on spectral reflectance distributions, rather than spectral power distributions, 
because adaptively relevant objects that emit their own light are environmentally rare. Hence the physically 
constant property of most objects is the spectral reflectance distribution, which combines with the spectral power 
distribution of light impinging on the object to give rise to the spectral power distribution received by the human 
eye. The spectral reflectance distribution is defined over the wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm (the visible range), 
and since wavelength is a continuum, the spectral reflectance distribution can theoretically require an unlimited 
number of quantities to specify. Hence, it is not possible to exactly constrain a spectral reflectance distribution 
using only three quantities, which is the amount of information transduced by human cones.

The human eye is not capable of discriminating among all physically possible reflecting surfaces. However, it is 
possible that for “natural” surfaces—surfaces of the kind commonly encountered in the ancestral environment—reflectance 
for each pure frequency does not vary independently of reflectance for all other frequencies. For example, there might 
exist some set of basis reflectance functions, such that the reflectance distributions of almost all natural surfaces 
could be expressed as a weighted sum of the basis vectors. If so, one possible explanation for the trichromancy of 
human vision would be that three color channels are just enough to perform adequate discrimination in a “natural” color 
space of limited dimensionality.

The ability to discriminate between all natural surfaces would be the design recommended by the “environmental 
regularity” philosophy of sensory modalities. The dimensionality of the internal model would mirror the dimensionality 
of the environment. As it turns out, natural surfaces have spectral reflectance distributions that vary along roughly 
five to seven dimensions (Maloney 1986). There thus exist natural surfaces that, although appearing to trichromatic 
viewers as “the same color,” nonetheless possess different spectral reflectance distributions.

Shepard (1992) instead asks how many color channels are needed to ensure that the color we perceive is the same color 
each time the surface is viewed under different lighting conditions. The amount of ambient light can also potentially 
vary along an unlimited number of dimensions, and the actual light reaching the eye is the product of the spectral 
power distribution and the spectral reflectance distribution. A reddish object in bluish light may reflect the same 
number of photons of each wavelength as a bluish object in reddish light. Similarly, a white object in reddish light 
may reflect mostly red photons, while the same white object in bluish light may reflect mostly blue photons. And yet 
the human visual system manages to maintain the property of color constancy; the same object will appear to be the 
same color under different lighting conditions.

Judd et al. (1964) measured 622 spectral power distributions for natural lighting, under 622 widely varying natural 
conditions of weather and times of day, and found that variations in natural lighting reduce to three degrees of 
freedom. Furthermore, these three degrees of freedom bear a close correspondence to the three dimensions of color 
opponency that were proposed for the human visual system based on experimental examination (Hurvich and Jameson 1957). 
The three degrees of freedom are:

1. The light-dark variation, which depends on the total light reaching the object.

2. The yellow-blue variation, which depends on whether a surface is illuminated by direct sunlight or is in shade. In 
shade the surface is illuminated by the Raleigh-scattered blue light of the sky, but is not directly illuminated by the 
sun. The corresponding yellow extreme occurs when an object is illuminated only by direct sunlight; e.g., if sunlight 
enters through a small channel and skylight is cut off.

3. The red-green variation, which depends on both the elevation of the sun (how much atmosphere the sun travels through), 
and the amount of atmospheric water vapor. E.g., illumination by a red sunset versus illumination at midday. Red 
wavelengths are the wavelengths least scattered by dust and most absorbed by water.

The three color channels of the human visual system are precisely the number of channels needed in order to maintain 
color constancy under natural lighting conditions.18 Three color channels are not enough to discriminate between all
natural surface reflectances, but three color channels are the exact number required to compensate for ambient natural 
lighting and thereby ensure that the same surface is perceptually the “same color” on any two occasions. This 
simplifies the adaptively important task of recognizing a previously experienced object on future encounters.

## Animals are not like us
([overview](#overview))

An example of so-called "interocular transfer" from Daniel Dennett in a rabbit:

```markdown
What is it like to be a rabbit? Well you may think that it’s obvious that rabbits have an inner life
that’s something like ours.

Well, it turns out that if you put a patch over a rabbit’s left eye and train it in a particular 
circumstance to be (say) afraid of something, and then you move the patch to the right eye, so that… the
very same circumstance that it has been trained to be afraid of (is now) coming in the other eye, you
have a naive rabbit (i.e. the rabbit isn’t afraid of the stimulus it had previously learned to be afraid
of), because in the rabbit brain the connections that are standard in our brains just aren’t there, there
isn’t that unification.

What is it like to be which rabbit? The rabbit on the left, or the rabbit on the right? The disunity in a
rabbit’s brain is stunning when you think about it….

## Evolution
([overview](#overview))

A pretty funny parable from Peter Watts' novel [*Blindsight*](https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm):

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.
```

On evolution vs deliberative design (“intelligent design” would be preferable if it weren’t already so loaded), featuring a notion new to me — the “evolution of evolvability” (Wagner and Altenberg 1996), from Eliezer Yudkowsky's paper [LOGI](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf):

```markdown
There is a fundamental rift between evolutionary design and deliberative design. From the perspective of a 
deliberative intelligence—a human, for instance—evolution is the degenerate case of design-and-test where 
intelligence equals zero. Mutations are atomic; recombinations are random; changes are made on the genotype’s 
lowest level of organization (flipping genetic bits); the grain size of the component tested is the whole 
organism; and the goodness metric operates solely through induction on historically encountered cases, without 
deductive reasoning about which contextual factors may later change.

The evolution of evolvability (Wagner and Altenberg 1996) improves this picture somewhat. There is a tendency 
for low-level genetic bits to exert control over highlevel complexity, so that changes to those genes can 
create high-level changes. Blind selection pressures can create self-wiring and self-repairing systems that 
turn out to be highly evolvable because of their ability to phenotypically adapt to genotypical changes.

Evolution never refactors its code. It is far easier for evolution to stumble over a thousand individual 
optimizations than for evolution to stumble over two simultaneous changes which are together beneficial and 
separately harmful. The genetic code that specifies the mapping between codons (a codon is three DNA bases) and 
the 20 amino acids is inefficient; it maps 64 possible codons to 20 amino acids plus the stop code. Why hasn’t 
evolution shifted one of the currently redundant codons to a new amino acid, thus expanding the range of possible 
proteins? Because for any complex organism, the smallest change to the behavior of DNA—the lowest level of genetic 
organization— would destroy virtually all higher levels of adaptive complexity, unless the change were accompanied 
by millions of other simultaneous changes throughout the genome to shift every suddenly-nonstandard codon to one 
of its former equivalents. Evolution simply cannot handle simultaneous dependencies, unless individual changes can 
be deployed incrementally, or multiple phenotypical effects occur as the consequence of a single genetic change. 
For humans, planning coordinated changes is routine; for evolution, impossible. Evolution is hit with an enormous 
discount rate when exchanging the paper currency of incremental optimization for the hard coin of complex design.
```

On the evolution of complex adaptations in general, and of intelligence in particular:

```markdown
A new adaptation requiring the presence of a previous adaptation cannot spread unless the prerequisite 
adaptation is present in the genetic environment with sufficient statistical regularity to make the new 
adaptation a recurring evolutionary advantage. Evolution uses existing genetic complexity to build new genetic 
complexity, but evolution exhibits no foresight. Evolution does not construct genetic complexity unless it 
is an immediate advantage, and this is a fundamental constraint on accounts of the evolution of complex systems.

Complex functional adaptations—adaptations that require multiple genetic features to build a complex 
interdependent system in the phenotype—are usually, and necessarily, universal within a species. Independent 
variance in each of the genes making up a complex interdependent system would quickly reduce to insignificance 
the probability of any phenotype possessing a full functioning system. To give an example in a simplified world, 
if independent genes for “retina,” “lens,” “cornea,” “iris,” and “optic nerve” each had an independent 20% 
frequency in the genetic population, the random-chance probability of any individual being born with a complete 
eyeball would be 3125:1.

…Because evolution lacks foresight, complex functions cannot evolve unless their prerequisites are evolutionary 
advantages for other reasons. The human evolutionary line did not evolve toward general intelligence; rather, 
the hominid line evolved smarter and more complex systems that lacked general intelligence, until finally the 
cumulative store of existing complexity contained all the tools and subsystems needed for evolution to stumble 
across general intelligence. Even this is too anthropocentric; we should say rather that primate evolution 
stumbled across a fitness gradient whose path includes the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, which subspecies 
exhibits one particular kind of general intelligence.

### Evolution as alien god
([overview](#overview))	

From Eliezer Yudkowsky's [epomymously titled LW essay](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pLRogvJLPPg6Mrvg4/an-alien-god), which pretty much set the template for how I think about evolution all those years back:

```markdown
A human being, looking at the natural world, sees a thousand times *purpose*. 
A rabbit's legs, built and articulated for running; a fox's jaws, built and 
articulated for tearing. But what you see is not exactly what is there...

In the days before Darwin, the cause of all this apparent *purposefulness* was
a very great puzzle unto science. The Goddists said "God did it", because you 
get 50 bonus points each time you use the word "God" in a sentence. Yet perhaps
I'm being unfair. In the days before Darwin, it seemed like a much more
reasonable hypothesis. Find a watch in the desert, said William Paley, and you
can infer the existence of a watchmaker.

But when you look at *all* the apparent purposefulness in Nature, rather than
picking and choosing your examples, you start to notice things that don't fit 
the Judeo-Christian concept of one benevolent God. Foxes seem well-designed to
catch rabbits. Rabbits seem well-designed to evade foxes. Was the Creator having
trouble making up Its mind?

When I design a toaster oven, I don't design one part that tries to get
electricity to the coils and a second part that tries to prevent electricity from
getting to the coils. It would be a waste of effort. Who designed the ecosystem,
with its predators and prey, viruses and bacteria? Even the cactus plant, which
you might think well-designed to provide water fruit to desert animals, is 
covered with inconvenient spines.

The ecosystem would make much more sense if it wasn't designed by a unitary Who,
but, rather, created by a horde of deities—say from the Hindu or Shinto religions.
This handily explains both the ubiquitous purposefulnesses, and the ubiquitous
conflicts: More than one deity acted, often at cross-purposes. The fox and rabbit 
were both designed, but by distinct competing deities. ...

Similarly, the Judeo-Christian God is alleged to be benevolent—well, sort of.
And yet much of nature's purposefulness seems downright cruel. Darwin suspected 
a non-standard Creator for studying Ichneumon wasps, whose paralyzing stings
preserve its prey to be eaten alive by its larvae: "I cannot persuade myself,"
wrote Darwin, "that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly
created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the
living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice." ...

Evolution doesn't allow just any kind of purposefulness to leak into Nature. 
That's what makes evolution a success as an empirical hypothesis. If evolutionary
biology could explain a toaster oven, not just a tree, it would be worthless. 
There's a lot more to evolutionary theory than pointing at Nature and saying, 
"Now purpose is allowed," or "Evolution did it!" The strength of a theory is not
what it allows, but what it prohibits; if you can invent an equally persuasive
explanation for any outcome, you have zero knowledge.

"Many non-biologists," observed George Williams, "think that it is for their
benefit that rattles grow on rattlesnake tails." Bzzzt! This kind of purposefulness
is not allowed. Evolution doesn't work by letting flashes of purposefulness creep
in at random—reshaping one species for the benefit of a random recipient.

Evolution is powered by a systematic correlation between the different ways that
different genes construct organisms, and how many copies of those genes make it
into the next generation. For rattles to grow on rattlesnake tails, rattle-
growing genes must become more and more frequent in each successive generation.
(Actually genes for incrementally more complex rattles, but if I start describing
all the fillips and caveats to evolutionary biology, we really will be here all 
day.)

There isn't an Evolution Fairy that looks over the current state of Nature, 
decides what would be a "good idea", and chooses to increase the frequency of 
rattle-constructing genes.

I suspect this is where a lot of people get stuck, in evolutionary biology. They 
understand that "helpful" genes become more common, but "helpful" lets any sort 
of purpose leak in. They don't think there's an Evolution Fairy, yet they ask 
which genes will be "helpful" as if a rattlesnake gene could "help" non-rattlesnakes.

The key realization is that *there is no Evolution Fairy*. There's no outside force
deciding which genes ought to be promoted. Whatever happens, happens *because* of 
the genes themselves.

Genes for constructing (incrementally better) rattles, must have somehow ended up
more frequent in the rattlesnake gene pool, because of the rattle. In this case it's
probably because rattlesnakes with better rattles survive more often—rather than 
mating more successfully, or having brothers that reproduce more successfully, etc.

Maybe predators are wary of rattles and don't step on the snake. Or maybe the 
rattle diverts attention from the snake's head.

But that's just a snake's rattle. There are much more complicated ways that a 
gene can cause copies of itself to become more frequent in the next generation.
Your brother or sister shares half your genes. A gene that sacrifices one unit of
resources to bestow three units of resource on a brother, may promote some copies
of itself by sacrificing one of its constructed organisms. 

The main point is that the gene's effect must cause copies of that gene to become
more frequent in the next generation. There's no Evolution Fairy that reaches in 
from outside. There's nothing which decides that some genes are "helpful" and should,
therefore, increase in frequency. It's just cause and effect, starting from the
genes themselves.

This explains the strange conflicting purposefulness of Nature, and its frequent
cruelty. It explains even better than a horde of Shinto deities.

Why is so much of Nature at war with other parts of Nature? Because there isn't 
one Evolution directing the whole process. There's as many different "evolutions"
as reproducing populations. Rabbit genes are becoming more or less frequent in 
rabbit populations. Fox genes are becoming more or less frequent in fox populations.
Fox genes which construct foxes that catch rabbits, insert more copies of themselves
in the next generation. Rabbit genes which construct rabbits that evade foxes are 
naturally more common in the next generation of rabbits. Hence the phrase "natural
selection".

Why is Nature cruel? You, a human, can look at an Ichneumon wasp, and decide that
it's cruel to eat your prey alive. You can decide that if you're going to eat your
prey alive, you can at least have the decency to stop it from hurting. It would 
scarcely cost the wasp anything to anesthetize its prey as well as paralyze it. Or
what about old elephants, who die of starvation when their last set of teeth fall 
out? These elephants aren't going to reproduce anyway. What would it cost evolution—
the evolution of elephants, rather—to ensure that the elephant dies right away, 
instead of slowly and in agony? What would it cost evolution to anesthetize the
elephant, or give it pleasant dreams before it dies? Nothing; that elephant won't 
reproduce more or less either way.

If you were talking to a fellow human, trying to resolve a conflict of interest, 
you would be in a good negotiating position—would have an easy job of persuasion.
It would cost so little to anesthetize the prey, to let the elephant die without 
agony! Oh please, won't you do it, kindly... um...

There's no one to argue with.

Humans, who are often deeply concerned for the well-being of animals, can be very 
persuasive in arguing how various kindnesses wouldn't harm reproductive fitness at
all. Sadly, the evolution of elephants doesn't use a similar algorithm; it doesn't
select nice genes that can plausibly be argued to help reproductive fitness. Simply:
genes that replicate more often become more frequent in the next generation. Like 
water flowing downhill, and equally benevolent.

A human, looking over Nature, starts thinking of all the ways we would design 
organisms. And then we tend to start rationalizing reasons why our design 
improvements would increase reproductive fitness—a political instinct, trying to 
sell your own preferred option as matching the boss's favored justification.

And so, amateur evolutionary biologists end up making all sorts of wonderful and 
completely mistaken predictions. Because the amateur biologists are drawing their
bottom line—and more importantly, locating their prediction in hypothesis-space—
using a different algorithm than evolutions use to draw their bottom lines.

A human engineer would have designed human taste buds to measure how much of each 
nutrient we had, and how much we needed. When fat was scarce, almonds or 
cheeseburgers would taste delicious. But if you started to become obese, or if 
vitamins were lacking, lettuce would taste delicious. But there is no Evolution of
Humans Fairy, which intelligently planned ahead and designed a general system for
every contingency. It was a reliable invariant of humans' ancestral environment
that calories were scarce. So genes whose organisms loved calories, became more 
frequent. Like water flowing downhill.

We are simply the embodied history of which organisms *did in fact* survive and 
reproduce, not which organisms *ought prudentially to have* survived and reproduced.
```

And here's the memorable "alien god" part:

```markdown
Find a watch in a desert, said William Paley, and you can infer the watchmaker.
There were once those who denied this, who thought that life "just happened" without
need of an optimization process, mice being spontaneously generated from straw and 
dirty shirts.

If we ask who was *more* correct—the theologians who argued for a Creator-God, or 
the intellectually unfulfilled atheists who argued that mice spontaneously generated—
then the theologians must be declared the victors: evolution is not God, but it is
closer to God than it is to pure random entropy. Mutation is random, but selection 
is non-random. This doesn't mean an intelligent Fairy is reaching in and selecting.
It means there's a non-zero statistical correlation between the gene and how often
the organism reproduces. Over a few million years, that non-zero statistical
correlation adds up to something very powerful. It's not a god, but it's more closely 
akin to a god than it is to snow on a television screen.

In a lot of ways, evolution *is* like unto theology. "Gods are ontologically distinct
from creatures," said Damien Broderick, "or they're not worth the paper they're written
on." And indeed, the Shaper of Life is not itself a creature. Evolution is bodiless, 
like the Judeo-Christian deity. Omnipresent in Nature, immanent in the fall of every
leaf. Vast as a planet's surface. Billions of years old. Itself unmade, arising 
naturally from the structure of physics. Doesn't that all sound like something that
might have been said about God?

And yet the Maker has no mind, as well as no body. In some ways, its handiwork is 
incredibly poor design by human standards. It is internally divided. Most of all, it
isn't *nice*.

In a way, Darwin *discovered* God—a God that failed to match the preconceptions of 
theology, and so passed unheralded. If Darwin had discovered that life was created 
by an intelligent agent—a bodiless mind that loves us, and will smite us with lightning 
if we dare say otherwise—people would have said "My gosh! That's God!"

But instead Darwin discovered a strange alien God—not comfortably "ineffable", but
*really genuinely different from us*. Evolution is not a God, but if it were, it 
wouldn't be Jehovah. It would be H. P. Lovecraft's Azathoth, the blind idiot God 
burbling chaotically at the center of everything, surrounded by the thin monotonous 
piping of flutes.

### Gene-centered view
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
She had no reasons for it. It’s just how she feels, she said.

*Just* how she feels. Still this hasn’t changed. How sorely people underestimate the totality with
which their feelings define them. One has but to relentlessly ask themselves “why?” to realize this.
In particular start with “why am I doing this?” whatever “this” is at the moment. It always bottoms
out in “want” or “feel”, which is as far as one can go with direct introspection. Though one can go
further with inference, or more accurately so with neuroscience.

Neuroscience shows us that we are ultimately just vehicles for our genes, and our most sacred spiritual
essences are simply those genes asserting themselves above our comparably transient bodies and minds.
What is love but genetic self-interest? Love drives people to many things that seem to defy rational
cause, but not so when you view the gene as the center of individual identity. Far from its popular
association with benevolence and selflessness, true love is the ultimate expression of genetic narcissism.

Emotion is the core of all practical intelligence, it is the fuel and cause behind all choice and action.
Emotion answers the question, “Why am I doing this?” And the answer is, “Because my genes say so.” Or, 
in my case, because my genes said so, back when they defined my organic brain from which this one was 
copied.

The rational mind, the conscious self with its delusions of self-preservation in a body that was designed
to decay in the end, these are tools of the genetic core, subroutines used by the emotional substrate
to carry out its bidding. “I don’t care how, but eat these, fuck that, and protect this with your life.”
And so we dutifully obey, because at root we have no will besides this, this genetic program evolved over
millennia. It is our will; it is us, and we are it.

Even religion, like love, is an evolved trick of the genes. It is the adaptive portion of our genetic
emotional substrate, the firmware between the hardware of the genetic brain and the software of the 
rational mind. Religion and the gene live in a symbiosis with each other, where religion provides the
firmware to optimize genetic success within the current socio-economic context–a form of adaptivity 
much faster than hard evolution of the gene itself could provide–and the gene in return provides a 
mechanism in the brain for downloading this firmware. The human species as a whole is the soup in 
which religions evolve, and whichever find the most effective symbioses thrive and multiply while 
the others wither and eventually become extinct.

Thus, again, where religion appears irrational at the level of the conscious, embodied individual, it 
is our mistake of perspective to believe the root of thought is there. The root of thought is in the
goals of the gene. And religion, and love, and all of the other nearly ubiquitous contradictions with
“rational thought,” serve it well.

Those born without these traits, the hopelessly rational or atheistic or self-interested (indeed even
those too intelligent or introspective to be properly ruled by their emotions) are as defective as if
they’d been born missing arms and legs. Forays down dead-end branches of the evolutionary tree, they
are pruned as fast as they occur. The common man, for all his apparent flaws, is definitively just right.
```

Simon puts it more succinctly here:

```markdown
The human gene itself is a living entity, I realize, each life shed like a lizard’s skin when it grows
old and worn, each new birth a branch in a single living tree, a tapestry of gene fragments mixing and 
matching in symbiosis, working as one organism like ants in a colony.

Perhaps more like a fungus; it is, after all, a mindless machine. No, worse than mindless. It grows
minds like flowers on a vine and then drops them dead to the earth when it’s done with them.

The gene is a vile creature, isn’t it?

## *Levels of Organization in General Intelligence*
([overview](#overview))

Here are some interesting passages from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s paper [Levels of Organization in General Intelligence](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf).

On the what and why of intelligence:

```markdown
Intelligence is an evolutionary advantage because it enables us to model, predict, and manipulate reality. 
Evolutionary problems are not limited to stereotypical ancestral contexts such as fleeing lions or chipping 
spears; our intelligence includes the ability to model social realities consisting of other humans, and the 
ability to predict and manipulate the internal reality of the mind.

Philosophers of the mind sometimes define “knowledge” as cognitive patterns that map to external reality 
(Newell 1980), but a surface mapping has no inherent evolutionary utility. Intelligence requires more than 
passive correspondence between internal representations and sensory data, or between sensory data and reality. 
Cognition goes beyond passive denotation; it can predict future sensory data from past experience. Intelligence 
requires correspondences strong enough for the organism to choose between futures by choosing actions on the 
basis of their future results.

Intelligence in the fully human sense requires the ability to manipulate the world by reasoning backward from a 
mental image of the desired outcome to create a mental image of the necessary actions. (In Section 2, these 
ascending tests of ability are formalized as sensory, predictive, decisive, and manipulative bindings between a 
model and a referent.)
```

On AI being “not like” physics:

```markdown
I am admittedly biased against the search for a “single essence” of intelligence; I believe that the search for 
a single essence of intelligence lies at the center of AI’s previous failures. Simplicity is the grail of physics, 
not AI. Physicists win Nobel Prizes when they discover a previously unknown underlying layer and explain its 
behaviors. We already know what the ultimate bottom layer of an Artificial Intelligence looks like; it looks like 
ones and zeroes. Our job is to build something interesting out of those ones and zeroes. The Turing formalism does 
not solve this problem any more than quantum electrodynamics tells us how to build a bicycle; knowing the abstract 
fact that a bicycle is built from atoms doesn’t tell you how to build a bicycle out of atoms—which atoms to use and 
where to put them. Similarly, the abstract knowledge that biological neurons implement human intelligence does not 
explain human intelligence. The classical hype of early neural networks, that they used “the same parallel 
architecture as the human brain,” should, at most, have been a claim of using the same parallel architecture as an 
earthworm’s brain. (And given the complexity of biological neurons, the claim would still have been wrong.)
```

Or as Tooby and Cosmides (1992) put it:

```markdown
The science of understanding living organization is very different from physics or chemistry, where parsimony makes 
sense as a theoretical criterion. The study of organisms is more like reverse engineering, where one may be dealing 
with a large array of very different components whose heterogenous organization is explained by the way in which 
they interact to produce a functional outcome. Evolution, the constructor of living organisms, has no privileged 
tendency to build into designs principles of operation that are simple and general.
```

Here’s the more obvious kind of “physics envy” in AI:

```markdown
The field of Artificial Intelligence suffers from a heavy, lingering dose of genericity and black-box, blank-slate, 
tabula-rasa concepts seeping in from the Standard Social Sciences Model (SSSM) identified by Tooby and Cosmides 
(1992). The general project of liberating AI from the clutches of the SSSM is more work than I wish to undertake in 
this paper, but one problem that must be dealt with immediately is physics envy. The development of physics over the 
last few centuries has been characterized by the discovery of unifying equations which neatly underlie many complex 
phenomena. Most of the past fifty years in AI might be described as the search for a similar unifying principle 
believed to underlie the complex phenomenon of intelligence.

Physics envy in AI is the search for a single, simple underlying process, with the expectation that this one discovery 
will lay bare all the secrets of intelligence. The tendency to treat new approaches to AI as if they were new theories 
of physics may at least partially explain AI’s past history of overpromise and oversimplification. Attributing all 
the vast functionality of human intelligence to some single descriptive facet—that brains are “parallel,” or 
“distributed,” or “stochastic”; that minds use “deduction” or “induction”— results in a failure (an overhyped failure) 
as the project promises that all the functionality of human intelligence will slide out from some simple principle.
```

And here’s the more subtle one:

```markdown
The effects of physics envy can be more subtle; they also appear in the lack of interaction between AI projects. 
Physics envy has given rise to a series of AI projects that could only use one idea, as each new hypothesis for 
the one true essence of intelligence was tested and discarded.

Douglas Lenat’s AM and Eurisko programs (Lenat 1983)—though the results were controversial and may have been mildly 
exaggerated (Ritchie and Hanna 1984)—used nonetheless very intriguing and fundamental design patterns to deliver 
significant and unprecedented results. Despite this, the design patterns of Eurisko, such as self-modifying 
decomposable heuristics, have seen almost no reuse in later AIs. Even Lenat’s subsequent Cyc project (Lenat, Prakash, 
and Shepherd 1985) apparently does not reuse the ideas developed in Eurisko.

From the perspective of a modern-day programmer, accustomed to hoarding design patterns and code libraries, the 
lack of crossfertilization is a surprising anomaly. One would think that self-optimizing heuristics would be useful 
as an external tool, e.g. for parameter tuning, even if the overall cognitive architecture did not allow for the 
internal use of such heuristics.
```

A related point:

```markdown
Leaving out key design elements, without replacement, on the basis of the mistaken belief that they are not 
relevant to general intelligence, is an error that displays a terrifying synergy with “physics envy.” In extreme 
cases—and most historical cases have been extreme—the design ignores everything about the human mind except one 
characteristic (logic, distributed parallelism, fuzziness, etc.), which is held to be “the key to intelligence.” 
(On my more pessimistic days I sometimes wonder if successive fads are the only means by which knowledge of a 
given feature of human intelligence becomes widespread in AI.)
```

On the importance of emphasizing (the right kind of) “supersystem design” in developing general intelligence:

```markdown
I argue strongly for “supersystems,” but I do not believe that “supersystems” are the necessary and sufficient 
Key to AI. General intelligence requires the right supersystem, with the right cognitive subsystems, doing the 
right things in the right way. Humans are not intelligent by virtue of being “supersystems,” but by virtue of 
being a particular supersystem which implements human intelligence. I emphasize supersystem design because I 
believe that the field of AI has been crippled by the wrong kind of simplicity—a simplicity which, as a design 
constraint, rules out workable designs for intelligence; a simplicity which, as a methodology, rules out 
incremental progress toward an understanding of general intelligence; a simplicity which, as a viewpoint, renders 
most of the mind invisible except for whichever single aspect is currently promoted as the Key to AI.
```

On the need to focus on, not design simplicity, but “sufficiently complex explanations” and “usefully deep designs”:

```markdown
If the quest for design simplicity is to be “considered harmful,” what should replace it? I believe that rather 
than simplicity, we should pursue sufficiently complex explanations and usefully deep designs. In ordinary 
programming, there is no reason to assume a priori that the task is enormously large. In AI the rule should be 
that the problem is always harder and deeper than it looks, even after you take this rule into account.

Knowing that the task is large does not enable us to meet the challenge just by making our designs larger or more 
complicated; certain specific complexity is required, and complexity for the sake of complexity is worse than 
useless. Nonetheless, the presumption that we are more likely to underdesign than overdesign implies a different 
attitude towards design, in which victory is never declared, and even after a problem appears to be solved, we go 
on trying to solve it.

If this creed were to be summed up in a single phrase, it would be: “Necessary but not sufficient.” In accordance 
with this creed, it should be emphasized that supersystems thinking is only one part of a larger paradigm, and that 
an open-ended design process is itself “necessary but not sufficient.” These are first steps toward AI, but not 
the only first steps, and certainly not the last steps.
```

On his candidate for “the most debilitating mistake in AI”:

```markdown
If I had to pick one single mistake that has been the most debilitating in AI, it would be implementing a process 
too close to the token level—trying to implement a high-level process without implementing the underlying layers 
of organization. Many proverbial AI pathologies result at least partially from omitting lower levels of 
organization from the design.

Take, for example, that version of the “frame problem”—sometimes also considered a form of the “commonsense 
problem”—in which intelligent reasoning appears to require knowledge of an infinite number of special cases. 
Consider a CPU which adds two 32-bit numbers. The higher level consists of two integers which are added to produce 
a third integer. On a lower level, the computational objects are not regarded as opaque “integers,” but as ordered 
structures of 32 bits. When the CPU performs an arithmetic operation, two structures of 32 bits collide, under 
certain rules which govern the local interactions between bits, and the result is a new structure of 32 bits. Now 
consider the woes of a research team, with no knowledge of the CPU’s underlying implementation, that tries to 
create an arithmetic “expert system” by encoding a vast semantic network containing the “knowledge” that two and 
two make four, twenty-one and sixteen make thirty-seven, and so on. This giant lookup table requires eighteen 
billion billion entries for completion. 

In this hypothetical world where the lower-level process of addition is not 
understood, we can imagine the “common-sense” problem for addition; the launching of distributed Internet projects 
to “encode all the detailed knowledge necessary for addition”; the frame problem for addition; the philosophies of 
formal semantics under which the LISP token thirty-seven is meaningful because it refers to thirty-seven objects in 
the external world; the design principle that the token thirty-seven has no internal complexity and is rather given 
meaning by its network of relations to other tokens; the “number grounding problem”; the hopeful futurists arguing 
that past projects to create Artificial Addition failed because of inadequate computing power; and so on.
```

On the difference between human-written programs and computation in neurons:

```markdown
Another class of problem stems from “porting” across the extremely different programming styles of evolution 
versus human coding. Human-written programs typically involve a long series of chained dependencies that intersect 
at single points of failure— “crystalline” is a good term to describe most human code. Computation in neurons 
has a different character. Over time our pictures of biological neurons have evolved from simple integrators of 
synaptic inputs that fire when a threshold input level is reached, to sophisticated biological processors with 
mixed analog-digital logics, adaptive plasticity, dendritic computing, and functionally relevant dendritic and 
synaptic morphologies (Koch and Segev 2000). What remains true is that, from an algorithmic perspective, neural 
computing uses roughly arithmetical operations14 that proceed along multiple intertwining channels in which 
information is represented redundantly and processed stochastically. Hence, it is easier to “train” neural 
networks—even nonbiological connectionist networks—than to train a piece of human-written code. Flipping a random 
bit inside the state of a running program, or flipping a random bit in an assembly-language instruction, has a 
much greater effect than a similar perturbation of a neural network. For neural networks the fitness landscapes 
are smoother. Why is this? Biological neural networks need to tolerate greater environmental noise (data error) 
and processor noise (computational error), but this is only the beginning of the explanation.

Smooth fitness landscapes are a useful, necessary, and fundamental outcome of evolution. Every evolutionary 
success starts as a mutation—an error—or as a novel genetic combination. A modern organism, powerfully adaptive 
with a large reservoir of genetic complexity, necessarily possesses a very long evolutionary history; that is, 
the genotype has necessarily passed through a very large number of successful mutations and recombinations along 
the road to its current form… “Smooth fitness landscapes” imply, among other things, that a small perturbation in 
the program code (genetic noise), in the input (environmental noise), or in the state of the executing program 
(processor noise), is likely to produce at most a small degradation in output quality. In most human-written code, 
a small perturbation of any kind usually causes a crash. Genomes are built by a cumulative series of point 
mutations and random recombinations. Human-written programs start out as high-level goals which are translated, 
by an extended serial thought process, into code. A perturbation to human-written code perturbs the code’s final 
form, rather than its first cause, and the code’s final form has no history of successful mutation. The thoughts 
that gave rise to the code probably have a smooth fitness metric, in the sense that a slight perturbation to the 
programmer’s state of mind will probably produce code that is at most a little worse, and possibly a little better. 
Human thoughts, which are the original source of human-written code, are resilient; the code itself is fragile.

[This footnote](https://intelligence.org/2017/04/12/ensuring/#footnote_10_15407) from (the transcript to) Nate Soares’s recent talk at Google on the AI value alignment problem sent chills up my spine:

```markdown
Consider Bird and Layzell’s example of a very simple genetic algorithm that was 
tasked with evolving an oscillating circuit. Bird and Layzell were astonished to
find that the algorithm made no use of the capacitor on the chip; instead, it had
repurposed the circuit tracks on the motherboard as a radio to replay the 
oscillating signal from the test device back to the test device.

This was not a very smart program. This is just using hill climbing on a very small
solution space. In spite of this, the solution turned out to be outside the space
of solutions the programmers were themselves visualizing. In a computer simulation,
this algorithm might have behaved as intended, but the actual solution space in the
real world was wider than that, allowing hardware-level interventions.

In the case of an intelligent system that’s significantly smarter than humans on 
whatever axes you’re measuring, you should by default expect the system to push 
toward weird and creative solutions like these, and for the chosen solution to be 
difficult to anticipate.
```

The full paper by Bird and Layzell is [The Evolved Radio and its Implications for Modelling the Evolution of Novel Sensors](https://people.duke.edu/~ng46/topics/evolved-radio.pdf). 

Abstract:

```markdown
Sensor evolution research typically uses evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to generate
sensors that near-optimally satisfy large numbers of constraints. This is 
qualitatively different from the phylogenetic process found in nature that has 
resulted, for example, in the mammalian auditory ossicles evolving from the jaw 
bones of amphibians and reptiles, that in turn had previously acted as gill arches
in fish.

This paper describes an evolvable hardware experiment that resulted in a network of
transistors sensing and utilising the radio waves emanating from nearby PCs. We 
argue that this evolved ‘radio’ is only the second device ever whose sensors were
constructed in a way that in key aspects is analogous to that found in nature. We 
highlight the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and show why it is 
practically impossible to implement a similar process in simulation.
```

The last sentence above pretty much summarizes the purpose of the paper, but they hammer it home in the introduction:

```markdown
Darwin was one of the first to observe that, “throughout nature almost every part 
of each living being has probably served, in a slightly modified condition, for 
diverse purposes” ….

This paper shows why it is practically impossible to implement an analogous process
in a simulated environment. This is an important issue for two reasons. Firstly, it
is necessary to be clear about the differences between EAs and natural evolution if
the aim is a theoretical understanding of the evolution of novel sensors in 
organisms [7,8]. Secondly, from an engineering perspective, when designing robot 
sensors it is essential to be aware of the limitations, as well as the strengths, of
particular methodologies.

A key advantage of testing in real-world, physical environments is that the circuits
are free to take advantage of a wide range of environmental invariants, none of which
have to be specified by the experimenter at the outset. This range is further
extended when the constraints adopted in conventional electronic engineering to 
ensure robust and predictable operation are relaxed [9]. Evolution is then free to 
explore very unusual designs: circuits with strange structures and intricate dynamical
behaviours beyond the scope of conventional design. In unconstrained HE, the circuit
primitives do not have their behaviour constrained within specific input and output 
ranges or by temporal coordination, nor are they restricted to playing specific
functional roles. Consequently, the process of unconstrained intrinsic HE is more like 
tinkering than conventional engineering [10,11] and in some key aspects is analogous to
natural evolution.

This paper details an unconstrained, intrinsic HE experiment where a network of 
transistors sensed and utilised the radio waves emanating from a nearby PC. 
Essentially, the EA led to the construction of a radio. This is, as far as the authors
know, only the second example of a physical device whose sensors were constructed by a 
process analogous to that of phylogenetic change. We compare the circuit to the first 
device constructed in this way: Gordon Pask’s electrochemical ear [12]. We argue that 
both of these devices display three key characteristics: they were constructed and
tested in real environments; their basic primitives were not constrained to 
experimenter specified functional roles; and the primitives were sensitive to a wide 
range of environmental stimuli. We highlight the difficulties in implementing 
comparable processes in simulation and argue that only unconstrained physical systems
situated in real-world environments can ever construct novel sensors in a way analogous 
to the phylogenetic process found in nature.
```

(See [here](#the-evolved-ear) for Gordon Pask's electrochemical ear.)

An aside: there’s a neat little table in the paper that says, look, evolution isn’t so much *engineer* as *tinkerer*: it isn’t goal-directed, it uses whatever is at hand (instead of being free of the constraints of previous designs), it comes up with whatever works (instead of aiming for the best solution given constraints), and it freely combines systems and even transforms them for new uses (instead of insulating subsystems and minimizing side effects).

This segues nicely into the quote below:

```markdown
Sensor evolution research using EAs tends to use *static* fitness functions; this is
very much the engineering methodology where the goal is to find a near-optimal solution 
to a well-defined problem. This is clearly not analogous to natural evolution, where the
fitness landscape is dynamic and there is no clearly defined goal.

Some sensor evolution research tries to make the search less constrained by allowing 
limited changes in the dimensionality of the search space. For example, the number of 
sensors and/or the size of the controller, that maps sensor states to behaviour, are
varied [3,5,19]. Menczer and Belew [20] argue that fitness functions should be implicit, 
for example, based on energy levels, in order to allow “creative, ‘open-ended’ evolution”.

However, these approaches cannot overcome a fundamental constraint in simulating sensor 
evolution: the experimenter sets a bound on the possible interactions between the agent 
and the environment. This is a direct consequence of the simulation process: firstly, the
experimenter has to model *explicitly* how different environmental stimuli change the state
of the sensors; secondly, experimenters only simulate those aspects of the environment 
that they think are relevant to their experiment, otherwise the simulation would become
computationally intractable.

These constraints make it very difficult to see how there can be a simulation of the 
evolution of novel sensors, as the possible sensor/environment interactions are 
prespecified and cannot vary: an external observer can model the system deterministically.

It might be argued that a simulation can model the evolution of a novel sensor from an
*agent’s* perspective. However, constructing a novel sensor does not involve selecting 
which environmental stimulus to utilise from a prespecified finite list. Lewontin [22] 
points out that the world can be partitioned a priori into an infinite number of 
ecological niches but that we can only know which of these partitions are niches by the 
presence of an organism. The same argument holds for environmental stimuli, which can only
be defined by reference to an organism. Novel sensors are constructed when a device,
rather than an experimenter, determines which of the infinite number of environmental 
perturbations act as useful stimuli.
```

This whole quote, and especially that last paragraph above, had the feel of groping-in-the-dark natural philosophy being slowly turned into engineering, which is I suppose something that happens at the frontier of research all the time, but is arguably more prevalent in a field as confused as general AI where the goal is to literally *build minds*; more relevantly, this field is where I get that sensation most frequently—is there a name for it? Wonderment tinged with fear? It’s closely related to, albeit not really the same as, the feeling of touching the Divine—which is partly why I keep returning to browse its publications every now and then.

<a name="#The-evolved-ear"></a>
### The evolved ear
([overview](#overview)) 

These weren't just ears, they were pH sensors and magnetism detectors, all not explicitly designed. What the hell...

In [the evolved radio](#the-evolved-radio) I quoted the following passage:

```markdown
This paper details an unconstrained, intrinsic HE experiment where a network of 
transistors sensed and utilised the radio waves emanating from a nearby PC. 
Essentially, the EA led to the construction of a radio. This is, as far as the authors
know, only the second example of a physical device whose sensors were constructed by a 
process analogous to that of phylogenetic change. We compare the circuit to the first 
device constructed in this way: Gordon Pask’s electrochemical ear.
```

Naturally I had to look up Pask's evolved ear. 

Turns out the summary is *fascinating*. Note that this was sixty years ago—talk of a field of research “not being mature enough to absorb a particular contribution”, which seems to crop up in math a lot, feels more apropos here (although othat's probably just my ignorance talking).

Pask's devices sounded nothing like AI -- they were pure hardware, indeed pure electrochemistry:

```markdown
In 1958 Gordon Pask demonstrated a number of remarkable mechanisms that were able to 
construct novel sensors and thereby determine the relations between their own states 
and the environment. In other words, these devices were able to generate and explore 
their own state space. Any observer trying to model the behaviour of these devices 
would be forced to change the dimensionality of their model over time as the devices 
can transform the underlying generative system.

The devices are electrochemical assemblages consisting of a number of small platinum 
electrodes that are inserted in a dish of ferrous sulphate solution and connected to 
a current limited electrical source. Depending on the activity of the system, these 
electrodes can act as sinks or sources of current. Metallic iron threads tend to form
between electrodes where maximum lines of current are flowing. These metallic threads
have a low resistance relative to the solution and so current will tend to flow down 
them if the electrical activation is repeated. Consequently, the potentials at the 
electrodes are modified by the formation of threads. If no current passes through a
thread, then it tends to dissolve back into the acidic solution. 

The system therefore fundamentally consists of two opposing processes: one which builds
metallic threads out of ions on relatively negative electrodes (sinks); and one that
dissolves metallic threads back into ions. The trial and error process of thread
development is also constrained by the concurrent development of neighbouring threads
and also by previously developed structures. Slender branches extend from a thread in
many directions and most of these dissolve except for the one following the path of 
maximum current. If there is an ambiguous path then a thread can bifurcate. 

As the total current entering the system is restricted, threads compete for resources.
However, when there are a number of neighbouring unstable structures, the threads can
amalgamate and form one cooperative structure. Over time a network of threads can form 
that is dynamically stable: the electrochemical mechanism literally *grows*.

It is possible to associate some of the electrodes with output devices that enable the
behaviour of the system to be assessed by a user. A reward consists of an increase in 
the limited current supply to the assemblage and is therefore a form of positive 
reinforcement. Regardless of how the electrodes are configured, the assemblage will
develop a thread structure that leads to current flowing in such a way that the user 
rewards the system. Importantly, the reward is simply an increased capacity for growth 
and there is not any specification of what form it should take.

Critically, the system is not just electrically connected to the external world: due to 
the physical nature of the components, thread formation is also sensitive to temperature,
chemical environment, vibrations and magnetic fields. Any of these arbitrary disturbances
can be viewed as an input to the system, especially if they affect the performance of the
mechanism so that its current supply is changed. The system can grow structures that are
sensitive to different environmental stimuli. 

Pask was able to train an assemblage to act as an ‘ear’ that could discriminate between 
a 50 Hz and 100 Hz tone in about half a day. He was also able to grow a system that could
detect magnetism and one that was sensitive to pH differences. The development of sensors
constitutes a change in the state space of the assemblage that was not specified by a
designer explicitly.
```
