## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

1. [Chinese perspective on Western elite](#chinese-perspective-on-western-elite)
2. [Cost disease](#Cost-disease)
2. [Critique of Freakonomics](#critique-of-freakonomics)
3. [Framing globalization and modernity in terms of corporations instead of nation-states](#Framing-globalization-and-modernity-in-terms-of-corporations)

## Cost disease
([overview](#overview))

I was finally moved to start this subsection by public transit nerd Alon over at [Pedestrian Observations](https://pedestrianobservations.com/about/), in particular his [cost disease essay](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2019/03/03/why-american-costs-are-so-high-work-in-progress/). But as with all things, my awareness of the phenomenon really began with Scott Alexander, in this case [his own cost disease essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/). 

The original use of the term comes from [Baumol's cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease), which is much more specific:

	the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor
	productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced
	higher labor productivity growth.
	
	For instance, if the retail sector pays its managers 19th-century-style salaries,
	the managers may decide to quit to get a job at an automobile factory, where 
	salaries are higher because of high labor productivity. Thus, managers' salaries
	are increased not by labor productivity increases in the retail sector but by 
	productivity and corresponding wage increases in other industries.
	
The original study talked about the performing arts:

	the same number of musicians is needed to play a Beethoven string quartet today as 
	was needed in the 19th century; the productivity of classical music performance has
	not increased. On the other hand, the real wages of musicians (as in all other 
	professions) have increased greatly since the 19th century.
	
This applies to other labor-intensive non-routine interaction jobs:

	In a range of businesses, such as the car manufacturing sector and other activities 
	that involve routine tasks, workers are continually becoming more productive by
	technological innovations to their tools and equipment. In contrast, in some labor-
	intensive sectors that rely heavily on non-routine human interaction or activities,
	such as nursing, education, or the performing arts, there is little or no growth in 
	productivity over time. As with the string quartet example, it takes nurses the same
	amount of time to change a bandage or college professors the same amount of time to
	mark an essay in 2006 as it did in 1966, as those types of activities rely on the 
	movements of the human body, which cannot be engineered to perform more quickly, 
	accurately, or efficiently in the same way that a machine, such as a computer, can.
	
But that's not what we care about. Scott notes that Tyler Cowen used it to describe a much wider range of civilizational inadequacies, which he introduces then summarizes as

	in the past fifty years, education costs have doubled, college costs have dectupled,
	health insurance costs have dectupled, subway costs have at least dectupled, and
	housing costs have increased by about fifty percent. US health care costs about 
	four times as much as equivalent health care in other First World countries; US 
	subways cost about eight times as much as equivalent subways in other First World 
	countries.

	I worry that people don’t appreciate how weird this is. I didn’t appreciate it for a
	long time. I guess I just figured that Grandpa used to talk about how back in his day
	movie tickets only cost a nickel; that was just the way of the world. But all of the
	numbers above are inflation-adjusted. These things have dectupled in cost even after
	you adjust for movies costing a nickel in Grandpa’s day. They have really, genuinely
	dectupled in cost, no economic trickery involved.

	And this is especially strange because we expect that improving technology and 
	globalization ought to cut costs. In 1983, the first mobile phone cost $4,000 – about
	$10,000 in today’s dollars. It was also a gigantic piece of crap. Today you can get a
	much better phone for $100. This is the right and proper way of the universe. It’s why
	we fund scientists, and pay businesspeople the big bucks.

	But things like college and health care have still had their prices dectuple. Patients
	can now schedule their appointments online; doctors can send prescriptions through the
	fax, pharmacies can keep track of medication histories on centralized computer systems
	that interface with the cloud, nurses get automatic reminders when they’re giving two
	drugs with a potential interaction, insurance companies accept payment through credit
	cards – and all of this costs ten times as much as it did in the days of punch cards
	and secretaries who did calculations by hand.

	It’s actually even worse than this, because we take so many opportunities to save money
	that were unavailable in past generations. Underpaid foreign nurses immigrate to 
	America and work for a song. Doctors’ notes are sent to India overnight where they’re
	transcribed by sweatshop-style labor for pennies an hour. Medical equipment gets 
	manufactured in goodness-only-knows which obscure Third World country. And it still 
	costs ten times as much as when this was all made in the USA – and that back when 
	minimum wages were proportionally higher than today.

	And it’s actually even worse than this. A lot of these services have decreased in 
	quality, presumably as an attempt to cut costs even further. Doctors used to make house
	calls; even when I was young in the ’80s my father would still go to the houses of 
	difficult patients who were too sick to come to his office. This study notes that for 
	women who give birth in the hospital, “the standard length of stay was 8 to 14 days in 
	the 1950s but declined to less than 2 days in the mid-1990s”. The doctors I talk to say
	this isn’t because modern women are healthier, it’s because they kick them out as soon 
	as it’s safe to free up beds for the next person. Historic records of hospital care
	generally describe leisurely convalescence periods and making sure somebody felt 
	absolutely well before letting them go; this seems bizarre to anyone who has 
	participated in a modern hospital, where the mantra is to kick people out as soon as 
	they’re “stable” ie not in acute crisis.

	If we had to provide the same quality of service as we did in 1960, and without the 
	gains from modern technology and globalization, who even knows how many times more health
	care would cost? Fifty times more? A hundred times more?

	And the same is true for colleges and houses and subways and so on.
	
Why isn't this due to the Baumol effect introduced above?

	health care and education aren’t paying their workers more; in fact, quite the opposite.
	
	Teacher salaries are relatively flat adjusting for inflation. But salaries for other jobs
	are increasing modestly relative to inflation. So teacher salaries relative to other 
	occupations’ salaries are actually declining.
	
	Professor salaries are going up a little, but again, they’re probably losing position 
	relative to the average occupation. Also, note that although the average salary of each
	type of faculty is stable or increasing, the average salary of all faculty is going down.
	No mystery here – colleges are doing everything they can to switch from tenured
	professors to adjuncts, who complain of being overworked and abused while making about 
	the same amount as a Starbucks barista.
	
The part where adjuncts make about the same as a barista at Starbucks is striking. 

Why cost disease? Scott forwards some guesses, then criticizes them.

Maybe it's an illusion? Maybe adjusting for inflation is hard, maybe wrong statistics?

	I don’t think this is true. The last time I talked about this problem, someone 
	mentioned they’re running a private school which does just as well as public schools
	but costs only $3000/student/year, a fourth of the usual rate. Marginal Revolution
	notes that India has a private health system that delivers the same quality of care
	as its public system for a quarter of the cost. Whenever the same drug is provided
	by the official US health system and some kind of grey market supplement sort of 
	thing, the grey market supplement costs between a fifth and a tenth as much; for 
	example, Google’s first hit for Deplin®, official prescription L-methylfolate, costs
	$175 for a month’s supply; unregulated L-methylfolate supplement delivers the same 
	dose for about $30. And this isn’t even mentioning things like the $1 bag of saline
	that costs $700 at hospitals. Since it seems like it’s not too hard to do things for
	a fraction of what we currently do things for, probably we should be less reluctant 
	to believe that the cost of everything is really inflated.
	
Maybe markets aren't efficient ("just don't work")?

	Suppose that people proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Khan Academy could teach
	you just as much as a normal college education, but for free. People would still ask
	questions like – will employers accept my Khan Academy degree? Will it look good on
	a resume? Will people make fun of me for it? The same is true of community colleges,
	second-tier colleges, for-profit colleges, et cetera. I got offered a free
	scholarship to a mediocre state college, and I turned it down on the grounds that I
	knew nothing about anything and maybe years from now I would be locked out of some 
	sort of Exciting Opportunity because my college wasn’t prestigious enough. Assuming
	everyone thinks like this, can colleges just charge whatever they want?

	Likewise, my workplace offered me three different health insurance plans, and I chose 
	the middle-expensiveness one, on the grounds that I had no idea how health insurance 
	worked but maybe if I bought the cheap one I’d get sick and regret my choice, and 
	maybe if I bought the expensive one I wouldn’t be sick and regret my choice. I am a 
	doctor, my employer is a hospital, and the health insurance was for treatment in my 
	own health system. The moral of the story is that I am an idiot. The second moral of
	the story is that people probably are not super-informed health care consumers.

	This can’t be pure price-gouging, since corporate profits haven’t increased nearly
	enough to be where all the money is going. But a while ago a commenter linked me to
	the Delta Cost Project, which scrutinizes the exact causes of increasing college
	tuition. Some of it is the administrative bloat that you would expect. But a lot of it
	is fun “student life” types of activities like clubs, festivals, and paying Milo
	Yiannopoulos to speak and then cleaning up after the ensuing riots. These sorts of 
	things improve the student experience, but I’m not sure that the average student would 
	rather go to an expensive college with clubs/festivals/Milo than a cheap college without
	them. More important, it doesn’t really seem like the average student is offered this 
	choice.
	
Maybe (as the anecdotes above suggest) government is just inefficient relative to private industry?

	I don’t think so. The government handles most primary education and subways, and has 
	its hand in health care. But we know that for-profit hospitals aren’t much cheaper 
	than government hospitals, and that private schools usually aren’t much cheaper (and 
	are sometimes more expensive) than government schools. And private colleges cost more
	than government-funded ones.
	
(That was a bit confusing, because some of it conflicted with the previous anecdotes.)

Maybe it's government regulation? That affects public and private companies both.

	his seems to be at least part of the story in health care, given how much money you
	can save by grey-market practices that avoid the FDA. It’s harder to apply it to 
	colleges, though some people have pointed out regulations like Title IX that affect 
	the educational sector.

	One factor that seems to speak out against this is that starting with Reagan in 1980,
	and picking up steam with Gingrich in 1994, we got an increasing presence of 
	Republicans in government who declared war on overregulation – but the cost disease
	proceeded unabated. This is suspicious, but in fairness to the Republicans, they did
	sort of fail miserably at deregulating things.	
	
	what about pet health care? Veterinary care is much less regulated than human health 
	care, yet its cost is rising as fast (or faster) than that of the human medical system
	
Maybe the increased regulatory complexity isn't through literal regulations but fear of lawsuits? Scott says this is pretty convincing to him, since it jives with his professional experience:

	That is, might institutions add extra layers of administration and expense not because
	they’re forced to, but because they fear being sued if they don’t and then something 
	goes wrong?

	I see this all the time in medicine. A patient goes to the hospital with a heart attack.
	While he’s recovering, he tells his doctor that he’s really upset about all of this. 
	Any normal person would say “You had a heart attack, of course you’re upset, get over 
	it.” But if his doctor says this, and then a year later he commits suicide for some 
	unrelated reason, his family can sue the doctor for “not picking up the warning signs”
	and win several million dollars. So now the doctor consults a psychiatrist, who does an
	hour-long evaluation, charges the insurance company $500, and determines using her 
	immense clinical expertise that the patient is upset because he just had a heart attack.

	Those outside the field have no idea how much of medicine is built on this principle. 
	People often say that the importance of lawsuits to medical cost increases is overrated
	because malpractice insurance doesn’t cost that much, but the situation above would never
	look lawsuit-related; the whole thing only works because everyone involved documents it 
	as well-justified psychiatric consult to investigate depression. Apparently some studies
	suggest this isn’t happening, but all they do is survey doctors, and with all due respect
	all the doctors I know say the opposite.

	This has nothing to do with government regulations (except insofar as these make lawsuits
	easier or harder), but it sure can drive cost increases, and it might apply to fields 
	outside medicine as well.	
	
Maybe our risk tolerance is lower?

	That is, might increased caution be due not purely to lawsuitphobia, but to really 
	caring more about whether or not people are protected? I read stuff every so often
	about how playgrounds are becoming obsolete because nobody wants to let kids run 
	around unsupervised on something with sharp edges. Suppose that one in 10,000 kids
	get a horrible playground-related injury. Is it worth making playgrounds cost twice 
	as much and be half as fun in order to decrease that number to one in 100,000? This
	isn’t a rhetorical question; I think different people can have legitimately different
	opinions here (though there are probably some utilitarian things we can do to improve
	them).

	To bring back the lawsuit point, some of this probably relates to a difference between
	personal versus institutional risk tolerance. Every so often, an elderly person 
	getting up to walk to the bathroom will fall and break their hip. This is a fact of
	life, and elderly people deal with it every day. Most elderly people I know don’t spend
	thousands of dollars fall-proofing the route from their bed to their bathroom, or
	hiring people to watch them at every moment to make sure they don’t fall, or buy a 
	bedside commode to make bathroom-related falls impossible. This suggests a revealed 
	preference that elderly people are willing to tolerate a certain fall probability in
	order to save money and convenience. Hospitals, which face huge lawsuits if any elderly
	person falls on the premises, are not willing to tolerate that probability. They put
	rails on elderly people’s beds, place alarms on them that will go off if the elderly 
	person tries to leave the bed without permission, and hire patient care assistants who 
	among other things go around carefully holding elderly people upright as they walk to 
	the bathroom (I assume this job will soon require at least a master’s degree). As more 
	things become institutionalized and the level of acceptable institutional risk tolerance
	becomes lower, this could shift the cost-risk tradeoff even if there isn’t a population-
	level trend towards more risk-aversion.	
	
Maybe things cost more for those who pay to compensate for those who don't pay?

	This is somewhat true of colleges, where an increasing number of people are getting in on scholarships funded by the tuition of non-scholarship students.
	
	I haven’t been able to find great statistics on this, but one argument against: 
	couldn’t a college just not fund scholarships, and offer much lower prices to its
	paying students? I get that scholarships are good and altruistic, but it would be 
	surprising if every single college thought of its role as an altruistic institution,
	and cared about it more than they cared about providing the same service at a better 
	price. I guess this is related to my confusion about why more people don’t open up
	colleges. Maybe this is the “smart people are rightly too scared and confused to go
	to for-profit colleges, and there’s not enough ability to discriminate between the 
	good and the bad ones to make it worthwhile to found a good one” thing again.

	This also applies in health care. Our hospital (and every other hospital in the 
	country) has some “frequent flier” patients who overdose on meth at least once a week.
	They comes in, get treated for their meth overdose (we can’t legally turn away 
	emergency cases), get advised to get help for their meth addiction (without the 
	slightest expectation that they will take our advice) and then get discharged. Most 
	of them are poor and have no insurance, but each admission costs a couple of thousand
	dollars. The cost gets paid by a combination of taxpayers and other hospital patients
	with good insurance who get big markups on their own bills.
	
This essay got over a thousand comments. Here are some of the interesting ones.

John Cochrane says the answer is administrative bloat:

	Things cost 10 times as much, 10 times more than they used to and 10 times more 
	than in other countries. It’s not going to wages. It’s not going to profits. So 
	where is it going?

	The unavoidable answer: The number of people it takes to produce these goods is 
	skyrocketing. Labor productivity — number of people per quality adjusted output —
	declined by a factor of 10 in these areas. It pretty much has to be that: if the
	money is not going to profits, to to each employee, it must be going to the number
	of employees.

	How can that happen? Our machines are better than ever, as Scott points out. Well,
	we (and especially we economists) pay too much attention to snazzy gadgets. 
	Productivity depends on organizations not just on gadgets. Southwest figured out
	how to turn an airplane around in 20 minutes, and it still takes United an hour.

	Contrariwise, I think we know where the extra people are. The ratio of teachers to
	students hasn’t gone down a lot — but the ratio of administrators to students has 
	shot up. Most large public school systems spend more than half their budget on
	administrators. Similarly, class sizes at most colleges and universities haven’t 
	changed that much — but administrative staff have exploded. There are 2.5 people 
	handling insurance claims for every doctor. Construction sites have always had a 
	lot of people standing around for every one actually working the machine. But now 
	for every person operating the machine there is an army of planners, regulators, 
	lawyers, administrative staff, consultants and so on.
	
Administrative bloat is an instance of a deeper issue arising in organic complex systems: technical debt. Or maybe it's related but not the same. Whatever. 

How does bloat come about? Protected monopolies:

	Regulations and law are, as Scott mentions, part of the problem. These are all 
	areas either run by the government or with large government involvement. But the 
	real key is, I think lack of competition. These are above all areas with not much
	competition. In turn, however, they are not by a long shot “natural monopolies” or 
	failure of some free market. The main effect of our regulatory and legal system is
	not so much to directly raise costs, as it is to lessen competition (that is often
	its purpose). The lack of competition leads to the cost disease.
	
	Everywhere we see businesses protected from competition, especially highly 
	regulated businesses, we see the cost disease spreading. And it spreads largely by 
	forcing companies to hire loads of useless people.

	Yes, technical regress can happen. Productivity depends as much on the functioning of 
	large organizations, and the overall legal and regulatory system in which they operate,
	as it does on gadgets. We can indeed “forget” how those work. Like our ancestors peer at
	the buildings, aqueducts, dams, roads, and bridges put up by our ancestors, whether Roman
	or American, and wonder just how they did it.
	
David "Goodhart's law" Manheim says the answer is superior goods and the sinkholes of unclear ROI around them:

	imagine a guy who makes $40,000/year and eats chicken for dinner 3 nights a week. 
	He gets a huge 50% raise, to $60,000/year, and suddenly has extra money to spend —
	his disposable income probably tripled or quadrupled. Before the hedonic treadmill
	kicks in, and he decides to waste all the money on higher rent and nicer cars, he
	changes his diet. But he won’t start eating chicken 10 times a week — he’ll start
	eating steak. When people get more money, they replace cheap “inferior” goods with
	expensive “superior” goods. And steak is a superior good.

	But how many times a week will people eat steak? Two? Five? Americans as a whole
	got really rich in the 1940s and 1950s, and needed someplace to start spending their
	newfound wealth. What do people spend extra money on?
	
	There are only a few things that we have a limitless demand for, but very limited
	ability to judge the impact of our spending. What are they?

	I think this is one big missing piece of the puzzle; in both healthcare and 
	education, we want improvements, and they are worth a ton, but we can’t figure out
	how much the marginal spending improves things. So we pour money into these sectors.

	Scott thinks this means that teachers’ and doctors’ wages should rise, but they 
	don’t. I think it’s obvious why; they supply isn’t very limited. And the marginal
	impact of two teachers versus one, or a team of doctors versus one, isn’t huge. 
	(Class size matters, but we have tons of teachers — with no shortage in sight, there
	is no price pressure.)

	What sucks up the increased money? Dollars, both public and private, chasing hard to
	find benefits.

	I’d spend money to improve my health, both mental and physical, but how? Extra
	medical diagnostics to catch problems, pricier but marginally more effective drugs,
	chiropractors, probably useless supplements — all are exploding in popularity. How 
	much do they improve health? I don’t really know — not much, but I’d probably try
	something if it might be useful.

	I’m spending a ton of money on preschool for my kids. Why? Because it helps, according
	to the studies. How much better is the $15,000/year daycare versus the $8,000 a year
	program a friend of mine runs in her house? Unclear, but I’m certainly not the only
	one spending big bucks. Why spend less, if education is the most superior good around?

	We pour money into schools and medicine in order to improve things, but where does the
	money go? Into efforts to improve things, of course. But I’ve argued at length before
	that bureaucracy is bad at incentivizing things, especially when goals are unclear. 
	So the money goes to sinkholes like more bureaucrats and clever manipulation of the 
	metrics that are used to allocate the money.

	As long as we’re incentivized to improve things that we’re unsure how to improve, the
	incentives to pour money into them unwisely will continue, and costs will rise. 
	
Anon reader says the answer is box-checking due to low institutional risk tolerance (in hedge funds at least), plus organizational complexity scaling quadratically with size (cf. HR department needing its own HR department):

	In the business I know – hedge funds – I am aware of tiny operators running perfectly 
	functional one-person shops on a shoestring, who take advantage of workarounds for 
	legal and regulatory costs (like http://www.riainabox.com/). Then there are folks like
	me who are trying to “be legit” and hope to attract the big money from pensions and 
	big banks. Those folks’ decisions are all made across major principal/agent divides 
	where agents are incentivized not to take risks. So, they force hedge funds into an 
	arms race of insanely paranoid “best practices” to compete for their money. So… my set
	up costs (which so far seem to have been too little rather than too much) were more 
	than 10x what they could have been.

	I guess this supports the “institutional risk tolerance” angle. There must be similar
	massive unseen frictions probably in many industries that go into “checking boxes”.

	Relatedly, a pet theory of mine is that “organizational complexity” imposes enormous 
	and not fully appreciated costs, which probably grow quadratically with organization 
	size. I’d predict, without Googling, that the the US military, just as a function of 
	being so large, has >75% of its personal doing effectively administrative/logistical 
	things, and that you could probably find funny examples of organizational-overhead-
	proliferation like an HR department so big it needed its own (meta-)HR department.
	
Scott ties this back to a lot of politically contentious topics -- college tuition, teacher's unions, healthcare, public housing etc -- with a parable:

	Imagine if tomorrow, the price of water dectupled. Suddenly people have to choose 
	between drinking and washing dishes. Activists argue that taking a shower is a basic
	human right, and grumpy talk show hosts point out that in their day, parents taught 
	their children not to waste water. A coalition promotes laws ensuring government-
	subsidized free water for poor families; a Fox News investigative report shows that
	some people receiving water on the government dime are taking long luxurious showers.
	Everyone gets really angry and there’s lots of talk about basic compassion and personal
	responsibility and whatever but all of this is secondary to *why does water costs ten 
	times what it used to?*
	
How this parable applies to soaring college tuition costs:

	If we give everyone free college education, that solves a big social problem. It also 
	locks in a price which is ten times too high for no reason. This isn’t fair to the 
	government, which has to pay ten times more than it should. It’s not fair to the poor 
	people, who have to face the stigma of accepting handouts for something they could 
	easily have afforded themselves if it was at its proper price. And it’s not fair to 
	future generations if colleges take this opportunity to increase the cost by twenty 
	times, and then our children have to subsidize that.

## Framing globalization and modernity in terms of corporations
([overview](#overview))

From an old essay of Venkat's, [A Brief History of the Corporation: 1600 to 2100](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/). I briefly wondered whether to put this subsection under the "business etc" section instead, but then again this is about trying to understand globalization, so here it goes.

The corporation is viewed as an intellectual construct. In a bit more detail:

```markdown
There are some who treat corporate forms as yet another technology (in this 
case a technology of people-management), but despite the trappings of 
scientific foundations (usually in psychology) and engineering synthesis (we
speak of organizational “design”), the corporate form is not a technology. 
It is the consequence of a social contract like the one that anchors nationhood. 

It is a codified bundle of quasi-religious beliefs externalized into an animate
form that seeks to preserve itself like any other living creature.

Organizational forms represent externalized mental models, codified concepts
and structure-following-strategy (as Alfred Chandler eloquently put it)...

We are not used to viewing world history through the perspective of the 
corporation for the very good reason that corporations are a recent invention, 
and instances that had the ability to transform the world in magical ways did
not really exist till the British East India Company (EIC) was born. ...

What was new was the idea of a publicly traded joint-stock corporation, an 
entity with rights similar to those of states and individuals, with limited 
liability and significant autonomy (even in its earliest days, when corporations
were formed for defined periods of time by royal charter).
```

The impetus for writing the piece:

```markdown
For quite a while now, I have been looking for the right set of frames to get me 
started on understanding geopolitics and globalization. For a long time, I was 
misled by the fact that 90% of the available books frame globalization and the 
emergence of modernity in terms of the nation-state as the fundamental unit of 
analysis, with politics as the fundamental area of human activity that shapes 
things. On the face of it, this seems reasonable. Nominally, nation-states 
subsume economic activity, with even the most powerful multi-national 
corporations being merely secondary organizing schemes for the world.

But the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve been pulled towards a business-
first perspective on modernity and globalization.

The human world, like physics, can be reduced to four fundamental forces: culture,
politics, war and business. That is also roughly the order of decreasing strength,
increasing legibility and partial subsumption of the four forces.

Culture is the most mysterious, illegible and powerful force. It includes such 
tricky things as race, language and religion. Business, like gravity in physics, is
the weakest and most legible: it can be reduced to a few basic rules and principles
(comprehensible to high-school students) that govern the structure of the corporate
form, and descriptive artifacts like macroeconomic indicators, microeconomic
balance sheets, annual reports and stock market numbers.

Now that you've analogized business to gravity, you need to flesh it out:

```markdown
One quality makes gravity dominate at large space-time scales: gravity affects
all masses and is always attractive, never repulsive.  So despite its weakness,
it dominates things at sufficiently large scales. I don’t want to stretch the 
metaphor too far, but something similar holds true of business.

On the scale of days or weeks, culture, politics and war matter a lot more in
shaping our daily lives. But those forces fundamentally cancel out over longer
periods.  They are mostly noise, historically speaking. They don’t cause 
creative-destructive, unidirectional change (whether or not you think of that
change as “progress” is a different matter).

Business though, as an expression of the force of unidirectional technological
evolution, has a destabilizing unidirectional effect. It is technology, acting
through business and Schumpeterian creative-destruction, that drives monotonic,
historicist change, for good or bad. Business is the locus where the non-human
force of technological change sneaks into the human sphere.

Of course, there is arguably some progress on all four fronts. You could say 
that Shakespeare represents progress with respect to Aeschylus, and Tom 
Stoppard with respect to Shakespeare.  You could say Obama understands politics 
in ways that say, Hammurabi did not. You could say that General Petraeus thinks
of the problems of military strategy in ways that Genghis Khan did not. But all
these are decidedly weak claims.

On the other hand the proposition that Facebook (the corporation) is in some 
ways a beast entirely beyond the comprehension of an ancient Silk Road trader 
seems vastly more solid. And this is entirely a function of the intimate 
relationship between business and technology. Culture is suspicious of 
technology. Politics is mostly indifferent to and above it. War-making uses it,
but maintains an arms-length separation. Business? It gets into bed with it. 
It is sort of vaguely plausible that you could switch artists, politicians and
generals around with their peers from another age and still expect them to 
function. But there is no meaningful way for a businessman from (say) 2000 BC 
to comprehend what Mark Zuckerberg does, let alone take over for him. Too much
magical technological water has flowed under the bridge.

Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic, but technology (and science) aren’t what create 
the visible magic. Most of the magic never leaves journal papers or discarded 
engineering prototypes. It is business that creates the world of magic, not
technology itself. And the story of business in the last 400 years is the story
of the corporate form.
```

Okay, so how to understand world history (and modernity, and globalization) via the lens of the evolution of corporations? 

A corporation's reach should be distinguished from its power:

```markdown
The apogee of power did not coincide with the apogee of reach. In the 1780s, 
only a small fraction of humanity was employed by corporations, but corporations
were shaping the destinies of empires. In the centuries that followed the crash
of 1772, the power of the corporation was curtailed significantly, but in terms
of sheer reach, they continued to grow, until by around 1980, a significant 
fraction of humanity was effectively being governed by corporations.

I don’t have numbers for the whole world, but for America, less than 20% of the
population had paycheck incomes in 1780, and over 80% in 1980, and the percentage
has been declining since... Employment fraction is of course only one of the many
dimensions of corporate power (which include economic, material, cultural, human 
and political forms of power).

It is tempting to analyze corporations in terms of some measure of overall power, 
which I call “reach.” Certainly corporations today seem far more powerful than 
those of the 1700s, but the point is that the form is much weaker today, even 
though it has organized more of our lives. This is roughly the same as the 
distinction between fertility of women and population growth: the peak in 
fertility (a per-capita number) and peak in population growth rates (an 
aggregate) behave differently.
```

Making sense of world history 1500-1800 through the story of the EIC in particular and corporate mercantilism in general:

```markdown
Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and the last Muslim ruler was thrown 
out of Spain in 1492, the year Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Vasco de Gama
found a sea route to India in 1498. The three events together caused a defensive
consolidation of Islam under the later Ottomans, and an economic undermining of 
the Islamic world (a process that would directly lead to the radicalization of 
Islam under the influence of religious leaders like Abd-al Wahhab (1703-1792)).

The 16th century makes a vague sort of sense as the “Age of Exploration,” but it
really makes a lot more sense as the startup/first-mover/early-adopter phase of 
the corporate mercantilism. The period was dominated by the daring pioneer spirit 
of Spain and Portugal, which together served as the Silicon Valley of Mercantilism.
But the maritime business operations of Spain and Portugal turned out to be the 
MySpace and Friendster of Mercantilism: pioneers who could not capitalize on their
early lead.

Conventionally, it is understood that the British and the Dutch were the ones who
truly took over. But in reality, it was two corporations that took over: the EIC 
and the VOC (the Dutch East India Company,  Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, 
founded one year after the EIC) the Facebook and LinkedIn of Mercantile economics
respectively. Both were fundamentally more independent of the nation states that 
had given birth to them than any business entities in history. The EIC more so 
than the VOC.  Both eventually became complex multi-national beasts.

A lot of other stuff happened between 1600 – 1800. The names from world history are
familiar ones: Elizabeth I, Louis XIV, Akbar, the Qing emperors (the dynasty is 
better known than individual emperors) and the American Founding Fathers. The events
that come to mind are political ones: the founding of America, the English Civil 
War, the rise of the Ottomans and Mughals.

The important names in the history of the EIC are less well-known: Josiah Child,
Robert Clive, Warren Hastings. The events, like Plassey, seem like sideshows on 
the margins of land-based empires.

The British Empire lives on in memories, museums and grand monuments in two countries.
Company Raj is largely forgotten. The Leadenhall docks in London, the heart of the 
action, have disappeared today under new construction.

But arguably, the doings of the EIC and VOC on the water were more important than the 
pageantry on land.  Today the invisible web of container shipping serves as the
bloodstream of the world. Its foundations were laid by the EIC.
```

Another convenient illustration of "the rise and fall of the corporation as an idea" -- I didn't know the proportion swung back up that sharply:

![rise-fall](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/freeagents.png)

How powerful was the EIC? Unimaginable by today's standards:

```markdown
It is difficult for us in 2011, with Walmart and Facebook as examples of
corporations that significantly control our lives, to understand the sheer 
power the East India Company exercised during its heyday. Power that makes 
even the most out-of-control of today’s corporations seem tame by comparison.
To a large extent, the history of the first 200 years of corporate evolution
is the history of the East India Company. And despite its name and nation of
origin, to think of it as a corporation that helped Britain rule India is to
entirely misunderstand the nature of the beast.

Two images hint at its actual globe-straddling, 10x-Walmart influence: the
image of the Boston Tea Partiers dumping crates of tea into the sea during the
American struggle for independence, and the image of smoky opium dens in China.
One image symbolizes the rise of a new empire. The other marks the decline of 
an old one.

The East India Company supplied both the tea and the opium.

At a broader level, the EIC managed to balance an unbalanced trade equation 
between Europe and Asia whose solution had eluded even the Roman empire.
Massive flows of gold and silver from Europe to Asia via the Silk and Spice 
routes had been a given in world trade for several thousand years. Asia 
simply had far more to sell than it wanted to buy. Until the EIC came along.

A very rough sketch of how the EIC solved the equation reveals the structure
of value-addition in the mercantilist world economy.

The EIC started out by buying textiles from Bengal and tea from China in 
exchange for gold and silver.

Then it realized it was playing the same sucker game that had trapped and helped 
bankrupt Rome.

Next, it figured out that it could take control of the opium industry in Bengal,
trade opium for tea in China with a significant surplus, and use the money to 
buy the textiles it needed in Bengal. Guns would be needed.

As a bonus, along with its partners, it participated in yet another clever trade:
textiles for slaves along the coast of Africa, who could be sold in America for
gold and silver.

For this scheme to work, three foreground things and one background thing had 
to happen: the corporation had to effectively take over Bengal (and eventually 
all of India), Hong Kong (and eventually, all of China, indirectly) and England.
Robert Clive achieved the first goal by 1757. An employee of the EIC, William 
Jardine, founded what is today Jardine Matheson, the spinoff corporation most 
associated with Hong Kong and the historic opium trade. It was, during in its 
early history, what we would call today a narco-terrorist corporation; the Taliban
today are kindergarteners in that game by comparison. And while the corporation 
never actually took control of the British Crown, it came close several times, by
financing the government during its many troubles.

The background development was simpler. England had to take over the oceans and 
ensure the safe operations of the EIC.

Just how comprehensively did the EIC control the affairs of states? Bengal is an 
excellent example. In the 1600s and the first half of the 1700s, before the
Industrial Revolution, Bengali textiles were the dominant note in the giant sucking
sound drawing away European wealth (which was flowing from the mines and farms of 
the Americas). The European market, once the EIC had shoved the Dutch VOC aside, 
constantly demanded more and more of an increasing variety of textiles, ignoring the 
complaining of its own weavers. Initially, the company did no more than battle the
Dutch and Portuguese on water, and negotiate agreements to set up trading posts on
land. For a while, it played by the rules of the Mughal empire and its intricate 
system of economic control based on various imperial decrees and permissions. The 
Mughal system kept the business world firmly subservient to the political class, 
and ensured a level playing field for all traders. Bengal in the 17th and 18th 
centuries was a cheerful drama of Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Indians, Chinese and 
Europeans. Trade in the key commodities, textiles, opium, saltpeter and betel nuts,
was carefully managed to keep the empire on top.

But eventually, as the threat from the Dutch was tamed, it became clear that the 
company actually had more firepower at its disposal than most of the nation-states 
it was dealing with. The realization led to the first big domino falling, in the 
corporate colonization of India, at the battle of Plassey. Robert Clive along with
Indian co-conspirators managed to take over Bengal, appoint a puppet Nawab, and get
himself appointed as the Mughal diwan (finance minister/treasurer) of the province 
of Bengal, charged with tax collection and economic administration on behalf of the 
weakened Mughals, who were busy destroying their empire. Even people who are familiar
enough with world history to recognize the name Robert Clive rarely understand the 
extent to which this was the act of a single sociopath within a dangerously unregulated 
corporation, rather than the country it was nominally subservient to (England).

This history doesn’t really stand out in sharp relief until you contrast it with the
behavior of modern corporations. Today, we listen with shock to rumors about the
backroom influence of corporations like Halliburton or BP, and politicians being in
bed with the business leaders in the Too-Big-to-Fail companies they are supposed to
regulate.

The EIC was the original too-big-to-fail corporation. The EIC was the beneficiary of
the original Big Bailout. Before there was TARP, there was the Tea Act of 1773 and 
the Pitt India Act of 1783. The former was a failed attempt to rein in the EIC, which
cost Britain the American Colonies.  The latter created the British Raj as Britain 
doubled down in the east to recover from its losses in the west. An invisible thread
connects the histories of India and America at this point. Lord Cornwallis, the loser
at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781 during the revolutionary war, became the second
Governor General of India in 1786.

But these events were set in motion over 30 years earlier, in the 1750s. There was no 
need for backroom subterfuge.  It was all out in the open because the corporation was
such a new beast, nobody really understood the dangers it represented. The EIC
maintained an army. Its merchant ships often carried vastly more firepower than the
naval ships of lesser nations. Its officers were not only not prevented from making
money on the side, private trade was actually a perk of employment (it was exactly this
perk that allowed William Jardine to start a rival business that took over the China 
trade in the EIC’s old age).  And finally — the cherry on the sundae — there was 
nothing preventing its officers like Clive from simultaneously holding political 
appointments that legitimized conflicts of interest. If you thought it was bad enough 
that Dick Cheney used to work for Halliburton before he took office, imagine if he’d 
worked there while in office, with legitimate authority to use his government power 
to favor his corporate employer and make as much money on the side as he wanted, and
call in the Army and Navy to enforce his will. That picture gives you an idea of the
position Robert Clive found himself in, in 1757.

He made out like a bandit. A full 150 years before American corporate barons earned 
the appellation “robber.”

## Critique of Freakonomics
([overview](#overview))

From Daniel Davies' [review](https://blog.danieldavies.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113336769665072876). The chief problem is "the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers":

```markdown
There are a number of things I don't like about Levitt's approach, but the biggest problem I have with
him is his[2] habit of saying (in various forms of words) "whichever way you look at the numbers, XYZ" 
when he means "whichever way I look at the numbers, XYZ". On a lot of these subjects (by far the most 
obvious example is abortion/crime, but it is an issue in all of them to a greater or lesser degree), 
Levitt is looking at quite large, clearly multicausal issues where any model is likely to be partial and
all manner of conflicting theories can claim support from the data. "Freakonomics" absolutely does not
recognize this fundamental truth of econometrics; it might be because the authors don't have the 
statistical chops to understand it but I think it is much more likely that they are just trying to copy 
the monolithic tone of voice adopted by social reformers and similar blowhards who hand out their 
assertions with no data at all. In all honesty, I think that theL&D approach is a retrograde step; it's
easy for the untrained reader to spot when someone has no empirical support at all for his position, but
much more difficult to deal with someone who systematically overstates the empirical support that he does
have. This is at least 90% of what makes John Lott so pernicious, and it seems to me that L&D are involved
at least partly in the same sort of game.

It's the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers. There are 
lots of people in this space, and not all of it is by any means bad. Any look at a difficult question is
going to be either hopelessly oversimplified or hopelessly unreadable, and I would certainly prefer it if
people erred in the first direction. There's also a decent Hayekian (or indeed Bayesian) point to be made
here that if you're entering into the marketplace of ideas to try and extract the truth from a number of 
differing viewpoints, then you want everyone to give you their idea, not to caveat it all about with bits 
and pieces of other people's ideas. That's why I'm prepared to give a (limited) free pass to Malcolm Gladwell 
or James Surowiecki when they write books like this which, in my view, present absurdly oversimplified views
of the world, because I understand what they're trying to do; to present their view on a question, not to 
give the final indisputable answer.

The problem comes in when someone attempts to present their view of a question as if it is the final
indisputable answer. A lot of the things in Freakonomics are things that I wouldn't make too much of a fuss
about if the authors were just advancing them as their view of one way of explaining the facts. But they
don't do that; at key points in the book, they keep claiming that they're reporting the facts when they're 
clearly (to me at least) reporting a particular spin on the facts. This is the pop-science approach to social
questions, because it's trying to combine the authority of a scientific investigation with the unequivocal 
certainty of a theoretical pronouncement. What Levitt and Dubner are doing is exactly the same thing that 
Thomas Friedman does; telling a bunch of stories and then explaining how these stories fit into their view of 
the world. However, in the case of Friedman it's always obvious that someone else could tell entirely
different stories about the same kinds of people and events and fit them into an entirely different worldview.
Because of the way that Freakonomics has pitched itself at the pop-science crowd (constantly banging on about
Levitt's John Bates Clark medal and referring to all the statistical analyses; for fans of cringeworthy 
exegesis, page 161 of the American edition contains what I strongly believe to be the worst description of the 
linear regression model ever committed to print), however, they are always either implying or outright saying
that their stories are the only ones consistent with the facts, so we can either fit their stylized facts into 
our own worldview or (preferably) drop ours and buy theirs. As you can tell, I don't like this.
```

Example Freakonomism: "the typical prostitute earns more than the typical architect". Davies says:

```markdown
This remark is asinine. What on earth are they talking about? There is probably a reasonable working 
definition of a "typical architect" (though I can think of about five different types of architect off 
the top of my head), but what is a "typical prostitute"? Do they mean per hour or on an average annual
earnings basis? Is there any data to back this up (the only study I could find put average earnings for 
street prostitutes in Los Angeles, who are about as "typical" as any other prostitutes at $23485 in 1991,
which seems low for an architect)? 

Fair enough, this is really just a throwaway remark aimed at illustrating a point about labour market 
theory, but surely the whole freakonomicsing selling point of this book was meant to be that the authors
didn't make lazy assumptions and throwaway remarks but checked things against the data. I'm sorry, but if
a bloke says "of course, prostitutes make a mint, they do, they earn much more than you or I", then in my
estimation it is going to count very much against his subsequent claim to never take things on trust or 
to tirelessly question conventional wisdom.
```

Another example, concerning swimming pools and guns:

```markdown
As presented in the book, the argument is obviously wrong. Levitt divides the number of child deaths 
caused by guns by the number of guns, then divides the number of child deaths caused by swimming pools 
by the number of swimming pools, compares the two numbers and says "if you have a gun in your house and
a swimming pool, the pool is more likely to kill your child than the gun". 

Which might or might not be true, but this calculation can't possibly be the right way to prove it. Riddle
me this; what proportion of the guns in the USA are held in households with no children in them? What
proportion of the swimming pools in the US are owned by households with no children in them? Is there 
perhaps a pretty good reason to believe that households which differ in their gun ownership and 
swimming-pool ownership will also differ in other potentially relevant ways? Is there a good reason to 
believe that the fact that a house has a child in it will be informative about the relative likelihood of
gun ownership and pool ownership? Now, Levitt might, for all I know, have actually done the more rigorous
analytic work which would support his claim here. But if he did, I bet he did it in a proper journal where
he stated the claim with the proper caveats and was totally clear about the degree of confidence that could 
be placed in it. But that's not what he does in "Freakonomics". He just a) puts the factoid straight in 
front of the reader with no qualifications at all and b) backs it up with a calculation that is clearly
flat out wrong. He's simultaneously teaching the lay reader to make definitive statements without
acknowledging estimation problems, and to ignore correlations between explanatory variables. How on earth 
can this not be worsening the overall level of debate?

## Chinese perspective on Western elite
([overview](#overview))

I love how Puzhong Yao comes across in his essay [The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/), about his experiences at Goldman Sachs, Cambridge and Stanford. He’s so honest and straight-laced he reminds me of myself before I ‘got more sophisticated’ in order to ‘navigate the turbulent realities of daily workplace politics’ (well, minimally, so I don’t drown). Here are some quotes I especially liked.

Result over process:

```markdown
My job at Goldman was a mixture of making markets to facilitate client trades and finding trades
for the bank’s own book. In early 2009, I believed it was an excellent trade to go long UK 
inflation. In fact, I thought it was such a good trade that my biggest worry was that there 
wouldn’t be anyone who would want to be on the other side of it. Yet we managed to put this
trade on versus a British bank. In the following year, the trade worked wonders, with UK 
inflation steadily rising, making the bank tens of millions in profits.

I thought I was an amazing trader. But there was a slight problem: I wanted to do the trade 
because I thought the market was pricing UK interest rates to go up. And when interest rates go 
up, UK inflation would rise mechanically due to the way it is defined and calculated. But in that
year, the Bank of England didn’t raise interest rates at all. Rather, the increase in inflation 
was due to things like tax increases, exchange rate fluctuations, oil price moves, etc.—things I
didn’t anticipate at all. It was pure luck that I made money, and I made it for the wrong reason.

When I was an intern, in one of the training presentations, a senior banker told us to distinguish
between the process and the results. He said that we should focus on the process, which we can
control, rather than the result, which is subject to luck. And here at Goldman, he said, we don’t
punish people for losing money for the right reason. I have always loved asking questions, so I 
asked him, was anyone ever punished for making money for the wrong reason? After giving it some
thought, he said that he had not heard of any such thing. And he was right. In fact, no one seemed
to remember the reason I did the inflation trade at all. They only remembered that I did this trade
and that it worked well.

When I met with my manager for a performance review after this, I was expecting to be berated for
my poor judgment. Instead, I got promoted! I told my manager that it was a mistake, but he merely
said, “Puzhong, tell no one.” He too was promoted on the basis of managing my “brilliant” trade. 
In fact, my manager was so proud of my work he recommended me to Stanford’s prestigious Graduate 
School of Business (GSB), and I soon set off for America.
```

Mottos as an example of Robin Hanson's "X isn't about Y":

```markdown
One class was about strategy. It focused on how corporate mottos and logos could inspire employees.
Many of the students had worked for nonprofits or health care or tech companies, all of which had 
mottos about changing the world, saving lives, saving the planet, etc. The professor seemed to like
these mottos.

I told him that at Goldman our motto was “be long-term greedy.” The professor couldn’t understand
this motto or why it was inspiring. I explained to him that everyone else in the market was short-term 
greedy and, as a result, we took all their money. Since traders like money, this was inspiring.

He asked if perhaps there was another motto or logo that my other classmates might connect with. I
told him about the black swan I kept on my desk as a reminder that low probability events happen with
high frequency.

He didn’t like that motto either and decided to call on another student, who had worked at Pfizer. 
Their motto was “all people deserve to live healthy lives.” The professor thought this was much better.

I didn’t understand how it would motivate employees, but this was exactly why I had come to Stanford:
to learn the key lessons of interpersonal communication and leadership.
```

On the importance of showing that you feel strongly about something, else it shows you aren't taking it seriously:

```markdown
On the communication and leadership front, I came to the GSB knowing I was not good and hoped to 
get better. My favorite class was called “Interpersonal Dynamics” or, as students referred to it,
“Touchy Feely.” In “Touchy Feely,” students get very candid feedback on how their words and actions 
affect others in a small group that meets several hours per week for a whole quarter.

We talked about microaggressions and feelings and empathy and listening. Sometimes in class the 
professor would say things to me like “Puzhong, when Mary said that, I could see you were really 
feeling something,” or “Puzhong, I could see in your eyes that Peter’s story affected you.” And I 
would tell them I didn’t feel anything. I was quite confused.

One of the papers we studied mentioned that subjects are often not conscious of their own feelings 
when fully immersed in a situation. But body indicators such as heart rate would show whether the 
person is experiencing strong emotions. I thought that I generally didn’t have a lot of emotions and
decided that this might be a good way for me to discover my hidden emotions that the professor kept
asking about.

So I bought a heart rate monitor and checked my resting heart rate. Right around 78. And when the 
professor said to me in class “Puzhong, I can see that story brought up some emotions in you,” I
rolled up my sleeve and checked my heart rate. It was about 77. And so I said, “nope, no emotion.” 
The experiment seemed to confirm my prior belief: my heart rate hardly moved, even when I was
criticized, though it did jump when I became excited or laughed.

This didn’t land well on some of my classmates. They felt I was not treating these matters with the
seriousness that they deserved. The professor was very angry. My takeaway was that my interpersonal
skills were so bad that I could easily offend people unintentionally, so I concluded that after 
graduation I should do something that involved as little human interaction as possible.
```
