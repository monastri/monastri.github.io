## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Economic rationality does not require minds
([overview](#overview))

From strangepoop's comment on Jacobjacob's essay [Unconscious Economies](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economies), quoting David Friedman's [Price Theory](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html):

	The second half of the assumption, that people tend to find the correct way
	to achieve their objectives, is called rationality. This term is somewhat
	deceptive, since it suggests that the way in which people find the correct 
	way to achieve their objectives is by rational analysis--analyzing evidence,
	using formal logic to deduce conclusions from assumptions, and so forth. No
	such assumption about how people find the correct means to achieve their 
	ends is necessary.

	One can imagine a variety of other explanations for rational behavior. To 
	take a trivial example, most of our objectives require that we eat occasionally, 
	so as not to die of hunger (exception--if my objective is to be fertilizer).
	Whether or not people have deduced this fact by logical analysis, those who
	do not choose to eat are not around to have their behavior analyzed by economists.
	More generally, evolution may produce people (and other animals) who behave
	rationally without knowing why. The same result may be produced by a process
	of trial and error; if you walk to work every day, you may by experiment find
	the shortest route even if you do not know enough geometry to calculate it. 
	Rationality in this sense does not necessarily require thought. In the final 
	section of this chapter, I give two examples of things that have no minds and 
	yet exhibit rationality.

## Incentives
([overview](#overview))

I debated for quite a while whether to put this under 'economics' or 'psych'. I would've clustered them together actually, if not for the feeling that econ clusters with globalization and polisci and psych with anthropology, linguistics, culture etc, and that these two clusters happen to be closest at econ/psych but would be more usefully understood as separate otherwise. This is one of the ways this first-try PKM scheme is breaking at the seams.

### How incentives work in practice
([overview](#overview))

In his essay [Unconscious Economies](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PrCmeuBPC4XLDQz8C/unconscious-economies), Jacobjacob articulates a distinction I've vaguely thought about. He gives 3 examples for each stage, I'll just quote one:

	There are at least three ways in which incentives affect behaviour: 

	1) via consciously motivating agents, 
	2) via unconsciously reinforcing certain behaviour, and 
	3) via selection effects. 

	I think perhaps 2) and probably 3) are more important, but much less 
	talked about.

	Example of 1):

		When content creators get paid for the number of views their videos
		have... they will deliberately try to maximise view-count, for 
		example by crafting vague, clickbaity titles that many people will
		click on.

	One objection you might have to this is something like:

		Look at those people without integrity, just trying so hard to 
		optimise whatever their incentives tell them to! I myself, and indeed
		most people, wouldn’t behave that way.

		On the one hand, I would make videos I think are good. ... I’m not some
		kind of microeconomic robot!

		And on the other hand, even if things were not like this… it’s just 
		really hard to creatively find ways of maximising a target. I don’t know
		what appeals to ‘the kids’ on YouTube, and I don’t know how to find out
		except by paying for some huge survey or something... human brains aren’t
		really designed for doing maximising like that. I couldn’t optimise in 
		all these clever ways even if I wanted to.

	One response to this is:

		Without engaging with your particular arguments, we know empirically that
		the conclusion is false. There’s a wealth of econometrics and micro papers
		showing how demand shifts in response to price changes. ...

		There’s a $10,000/year daycare close to where I live, and when the moms 
		there take their kids to the cinema, they’ll tell them to pretend they’re 
		6 and not 7 years old just to get a $3 discount on the tickets. ...

		All in all, if you give people an opportunity to earn some money or time… 
		they’ll tend to take it!

	This might or might not be a good reply.

	However, by appealing to 2) and 3), we don’t have to make this response *at all*.
	The effects of incentives on behaviour don’t have to be consciously mediated. Rather...	

		When content creators get paid for the number of views their videos have, 
		those whose natural way of writing titles is a bit more clickbait-y will 
		tend to get more views, and so over time accumulate more influence and 
		social capital in the YouTube community, which makes it harder for less 
		clickbait-y content producers to compete. No one has to change their
		behaviour/or their strategies that much -- rather, when changing incentives
		you’re changing the rules of game, and so the winners will be different.
		Even for those less fortunate producers, those of their videos which are 
		on the clickbait end of things will tend to give them more views and money,
		and insofar as they just “try to make videos they like, seeing what happens,
		and then doing more of what worked”, they will be pushed in this direction.
	
Okay, if this is true and important, why don't standard econ textbooks explain it? Jacob2 offers three reasons: selection pressure for explanations needing fewer inferential steps (because undergrads), focus on mathematical modeling, and focus on the properties of equilibria rather than the processes by which systems attain equilibria. 

JenniferRM quotes David Friedman's [Law's Order](https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Order-What-Economics-Matters/dp/0691090092), which "sort of explores how laws that ignore incentives or produce bad incentives tend to be predictably suboptimal", saying that 

	much of how people decide what to do is based on people finding someone who seems 
	to be "winning" at something and copy them.
	
	Friedman doesn't use the term "mimesis", but this is an extremely long-lived academic
	keyword with many people who have embellished and refined related theories. For 
	example, Peter Thiel has a mild obsession with Rene Girard who was obsessed with a 
	specific theory of mimesis and how it causes human communities to work in predictable
	ways. If you want the extremely pragmatic layman's version of the basic mimetic theory,
	it is simply "monkey see, monkey do" 
	
	If you adopt mimesis as THE core process which causes human rationality, it predicts 
	that no new things in the human behavioral range become seriously optimized in a 
	widespread way until AFTER at least one (maybe many) rounds of behavioral mimetic 
	selection on less optimized random human behavioral exploration, where an audience can 
	watch who succeeds and who fails and copy the winners over and over. ...
	
	In reality, it does seem to me that mimesis is a BIG source of valid and useful
	rationality for getting along in life, especially for humans who never enter Piaget's 
	"Stage 4" and start applying formal operational reasoning to some things. It works
	"good enough" a lot of the time that I could imagine it being a core part of any 
	organism's epistemic repertoire?

	Indeed, entire cultures seem to exist where the bulk of humans lack formal operational
	reasoning. For example, anthropologists who study such things often find that
	traditional farmers (which was basically ALL farmers, prior to the enlightenment)
	with very clever farming practices don't actually know how or why their farming 
	practices work. They just "do what everyone has always done", and it basically works...

## Cost disease
([overview](#overview))

I was finally moved to start this subsection by public transit nerd Alon over at [Pedestrian Observations](https://pedestrianobservations.com/about/), in particular his [cost disease essay](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2019/03/03/why-american-costs-are-so-high-work-in-progress/). But as with all things, my awareness of the phenomenon really began with Scott Alexander, in this case [his own cost disease essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/). 

The original use of the term comes from [Baumol's cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol's_cost_disease), which is much more specific:

	the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor
	productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced
	higher labor productivity growth.
	
	For instance, if the retail sector pays its managers 19th-century-style salaries,
	the managers may decide to quit to get a job at an automobile factory, where 
	salaries are higher because of high labor productivity. Thus, managers' salaries
	are increased not by labor productivity increases in the retail sector but by 
	productivity and corresponding wage increases in other industries.
	
The original study talked about the performing arts:

	the same number of musicians is needed to play a Beethoven string quartet today as 
	was needed in the 19th century; the productivity of classical music performance has
	not increased. On the other hand, the real wages of musicians (as in all other 
	professions) have increased greatly since the 19th century.
	
This applies to other labor-intensive non-routine interaction jobs:

	In a range of businesses, such as the car manufacturing sector and other activities 
	that involve routine tasks, workers are continually becoming more productive by
	technological innovations to their tools and equipment. In contrast, in some labor-
	intensive sectors that rely heavily on non-routine human interaction or activities,
	such as nursing, education, or the performing arts, there is little or no growth in 
	productivity over time. As with the string quartet example, it takes nurses the same
	amount of time to change a bandage or college professors the same amount of time to
	mark an essay in 2006 as it did in 1966, as those types of activities rely on the 
	movements of the human body, which cannot be engineered to perform more quickly, 
	accurately, or efficiently in the same way that a machine, such as a computer, can.
	
But that's not what we care about. Scott notes that Tyler Cowen used it to describe a much wider range of civilizational inadequacies, which he introduces then summarizes as

	in the past fifty years, education costs have doubled, college costs have dectupled,
	health insurance costs have dectupled, subway costs have at least dectupled, and
	housing costs have increased by about fifty percent. US health care costs about 
	four times as much as equivalent health care in other First World countries; US 
	subways cost about eight times as much as equivalent subways in other First World 
	countries.

	I worry that people don’t appreciate how weird this is. I didn’t appreciate it for a
	long time. I guess I just figured that Grandpa used to talk about how back in his day
	movie tickets only cost a nickel; that was just the way of the world. But all of the
	numbers above are inflation-adjusted. These things have dectupled in cost even after
	you adjust for movies costing a nickel in Grandpa’s day. They have really, genuinely
	dectupled in cost, no economic trickery involved.

	And this is especially strange because we expect that improving technology and 
	globalization ought to cut costs. In 1983, the first mobile phone cost $4,000 – about
	$10,000 in today’s dollars. It was also a gigantic piece of crap. Today you can get a
	much better phone for $100. This is the right and proper way of the universe. It’s why
	we fund scientists, and pay businesspeople the big bucks.

	But things like college and health care have still had their prices dectuple. Patients
	can now schedule their appointments online; doctors can send prescriptions through the
	fax, pharmacies can keep track of medication histories on centralized computer systems
	that interface with the cloud, nurses get automatic reminders when they’re giving two
	drugs with a potential interaction, insurance companies accept payment through credit
	cards – and all of this costs ten times as much as it did in the days of punch cards
	and secretaries who did calculations by hand.

	It’s actually even worse than this, because we take so many opportunities to save money
	that were unavailable in past generations. Underpaid foreign nurses immigrate to 
	America and work for a song. Doctors’ notes are sent to India overnight where they’re
	transcribed by sweatshop-style labor for pennies an hour. Medical equipment gets 
	manufactured in goodness-only-knows which obscure Third World country. And it still 
	costs ten times as much as when this was all made in the USA – and that back when 
	minimum wages were proportionally higher than today.

	And it’s actually even worse than this. A lot of these services have decreased in 
	quality, presumably as an attempt to cut costs even further. Doctors used to make house
	calls; even when I was young in the ’80s my father would still go to the houses of 
	difficult patients who were too sick to come to his office. This study notes that for 
	women who give birth in the hospital, “the standard length of stay was 8 to 14 days in 
	the 1950s but declined to less than 2 days in the mid-1990s”. The doctors I talk to say
	this isn’t because modern women are healthier, it’s because they kick them out as soon 
	as it’s safe to free up beds for the next person. Historic records of hospital care
	generally describe leisurely convalescence periods and making sure somebody felt 
	absolutely well before letting them go; this seems bizarre to anyone who has 
	participated in a modern hospital, where the mantra is to kick people out as soon as 
	they’re “stable” ie not in acute crisis.

	If we had to provide the same quality of service as we did in 1960, and without the 
	gains from modern technology and globalization, who even knows how many times more health
	care would cost? Fifty times more? A hundred times more?

	And the same is true for colleges and houses and subways and so on.
	
Why isn't this due to the Baumol effect introduced above?

	health care and education aren’t paying their workers more; in fact, quite the opposite.
	
	Teacher salaries are relatively flat adjusting for inflation. But salaries for other jobs
	are increasing modestly relative to inflation. So teacher salaries relative to other 
	occupations’ salaries are actually declining.
	
	Professor salaries are going up a little, but again, they’re probably losing position 
	relative to the average occupation. Also, note that although the average salary of each
	type of faculty is stable or increasing, the average salary of all faculty is going down.
	No mystery here – colleges are doing everything they can to switch from tenured
	professors to adjuncts, who complain of being overworked and abused while making about 
	the same amount as a Starbucks barista.
	
The part where adjuncts make about the same as a barista at Starbucks is striking. 

Why cost disease? Scott forwards some guesses, then criticizes them.

Maybe it's an illusion? Maybe adjusting for inflation is hard, maybe wrong statistics?

	I don’t think this is true. The last time I talked about this problem, someone 
	mentioned they’re running a private school which does just as well as public schools
	but costs only $3000/student/year, a fourth of the usual rate. Marginal Revolution
	notes that India has a private health system that delivers the same quality of care
	as its public system for a quarter of the cost. Whenever the same drug is provided
	by the official US health system and some kind of grey market supplement sort of 
	thing, the grey market supplement costs between a fifth and a tenth as much; for 
	example, Google’s first hit for Deplin®, official prescription L-methylfolate, costs
	$175 for a month’s supply; unregulated L-methylfolate supplement delivers the same 
	dose for about $30. And this isn’t even mentioning things like the $1 bag of saline
	that costs $700 at hospitals. Since it seems like it’s not too hard to do things for
	a fraction of what we currently do things for, probably we should be less reluctant 
	to believe that the cost of everything is really inflated.
	
Maybe it's market failures ("markets just don't work")?

	Suppose that people proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Khan Academy could teach
	you just as much as a normal college education, but for free. People would still ask
	questions like – will employers accept my Khan Academy degree? Will it look good on
	a resume? Will people make fun of me for it? The same is true of community colleges,
	second-tier colleges, for-profit colleges, et cetera. I got offered a free
	scholarship to a mediocre state college, and I turned it down on the grounds that I
	knew nothing about anything and maybe years from now I would be locked out of some 
	sort of Exciting Opportunity because my college wasn’t prestigious enough. Assuming
	everyone thinks like this, can colleges just charge whatever they want?

	Likewise, my workplace offered me three different health insurance plans, and I chose 
	the middle-expensiveness one, on the grounds that I had no idea how health insurance 
	worked but maybe if I bought the cheap one I’d get sick and regret my choice, and 
	maybe if I bought the expensive one I wouldn’t be sick and regret my choice. I am a 
	doctor, my employer is a hospital, and the health insurance was for treatment in my 
	own health system. The moral of the story is that I am an idiot. The second moral of
	the story is that people probably are not super-informed health care consumers.

	This can’t be pure price-gouging, since corporate profits haven’t increased nearly
	enough to be where all the money is going. But a while ago a commenter linked me to
	the Delta Cost Project, which scrutinizes the exact causes of increasing college
	tuition. Some of it is the administrative bloat that you would expect. But a lot of it
	is fun “student life” types of activities like clubs, festivals, and paying Milo
	Yiannopoulos to speak and then cleaning up after the ensuing riots. These sorts of 
	things improve the student experience, but I’m not sure that the average student would 
	rather go to an expensive college with clubs/festivals/Milo than a cheap college without
	them. More important, it doesn’t really seem like the average student is offered this 
	choice.
	
Noah Smith echoes this argument in the second half of his comment, and says that the answer to market failures is government regulation:

	The health-care market naturally has a lot of adverse selection — people with poor
	health are more inclined to buy insurance. That means insurance companies, knowing 
	its customers tend to be those with poorer health, charge higher prices. Also, 
	hospitals could be local monopolies. And college education could be costly in part
	because of asymmetric information — if Americans tend to vary more than people in 
	other countries with respect to work ethnic and natural ability, they might have to
	spend more on college to prove themselves. This is known as signaling.

	When high costs are due to market failures, interventionist government can be the 
	solution instead of the problem — provided the intervention is done right. So the 
	more active governments of countries like Europe and Japan might be successfully 
	holding down costs that would otherwise balloon to inefficient levels.	
	
Maybe (as the anecdotes above suggest) government is just inefficient relative to private industry?

	I don’t think so. The government handles most primary education and subways, and has 
	its hand in health care. But we know that for-profit hospitals aren’t much cheaper 
	than government hospitals, and that private schools usually aren’t much cheaper (and 
	are sometimes more expensive) than government schools. And private colleges cost more
	than government-funded ones.
	
(That was a bit confusing, because some of it conflicted with the previous anecdotes.)

Maybe it's government regulation? That affects public and private companies both.

	his seems to be at least part of the story in health care, given how much money you
	can save by grey-market practices that avoid the FDA. It’s harder to apply it to 
	colleges, though some people have pointed out regulations like Title IX that affect 
	the educational sector.

	One factor that seems to speak out against this is that starting with Reagan in 1980,
	and picking up steam with Gingrich in 1994, we got an increasing presence of 
	Republicans in government who declared war on overregulation – but the cost disease
	proceeded unabated. This is suspicious, but in fairness to the Republicans, they did
	sort of fail miserably at deregulating things.	
	
	what about pet health care? Veterinary care is much less regulated than human health 
	care, yet its cost is rising as fast (or faster) than that of the human medical system.
	
Noah Smith echoes the "government intervention can't be it" argument in the first half of his comment:

	Another usual suspect is government intervention. The government subsidizes college 
	through cheap loans, purchases infrastructure, restricts housing supply, and intervenes
	heavily in the health-care market. It’s probably part of the problem in these areas,
	especially in urban housing markets.

	But again, government intervention struggles to explain the difference between the 
	U.S. and other rich nations. In most countries, health care is mainly paid for by the
	government — many countries have nationalized the industry outright. Yet their health
	outcomes are broadly similar to those in the U.S., or even a little bit better. Other
	countries have strong unions and high land acquisition costs — often stronger and 
	higher than the U.S. — but their infrastructure is much cheaper. And there is no law 
	or regulation propping up high wealth-management fees or real-estate commissions. In
	general, lower-cost places like Japan and Europe have more regulation and more
	interventionism than the U.S.
	
Megan McArdle (of the "I don't understand you = I am stupid" post) says it's partly the bad kind of government intervention:

	It’s pretty easy to tell a libertarian story where markets work fine, but government
	intrusions into these markets have rendered them so unfree that they no longer
	function the way they’re supposed to. And I think that is at least part of the story
	here. Yes, these things are often procured from private parties. But everywhere you
	look you see the government: blocking new entry (through accreditation standards,
	“certificate of need” laws, and zoning and building codes), while simultaneously 
	subsidizing the purchases through artificially cheap loans and often, direct price 
	subsidies. It would be sort of shocking if restricted supply combined with 
	stimulated demand didn’t produce rapidly rising prices. Meanwhile, in areas that
	the government largely leaves alone (such as Lasik), we pretty much see what you’d 
	expect: falling prices and improving consumer service.
	
Apparently this is called the "Kling theory of public choice" in libertarianism. LukHamilton:

	I think you gave short shrift to libertarian explanations of this phenomena. In
	particular, the Kling Theory of Public Choice may explain a significant fraction 
	of cost disease: public policy will always choose to subsidize demand and restrict
	supply. If you restrict supply holding everything else equal, prices will go up.
	If you subsidize demand holding everything else equal, prices will go up. If you 
	do both, prices will really go up.

	(1) Healthcare: The government restricts the supply of all healthcare professionals
	(for example, doctors, nurses, CNAs, pharmacists, dentists, LPNs, etc.) via 
	occupational licensing. (I should note that maybe everyone can get behind the simple
	idea that the number of doctors per 10,000 people in the US should at least remain 
	constant over time and not go down, as it has.) It restricts the supply of 
	healthcare organizations (for example, hospitals, surgery centers, etc.) via onerous
	regulations, like the very ridiculous “certificate-of-need“. You have already 
	explained in previous posts how things like the FDA restrict the supply of generic
	drugs. In terms of demand, the government subsidizes health insurance via the 
	corporate income tax code, CHIP, the Obamacare marketplace, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.

	(2) Education: I have done less investigation into this sector’s regulations. You
	mentioned Title IX. David Friedman has some nice blog posts on how the American Bar
	Association’s regulations on law schools make cheap law schools impossible. (This 
	same concept also applies to healthcare-related professional schools, by the way.)
	If Bryan Caplan is right about signaling, a lot of education involves negative 
	externalities, so it should be taxed or limited by the government. Instead, it 
	subsidizes demand via loans. K-12 education, meanwhile, receives massive subsidies
	from the government; everyone can enjoy a totally free K-12 education.

	(3) Real estate: Land-use regulations restrict the supply of housing. (Explanations
	of this can be found by googling “Matt Yglesias housing”.) It also subsidizes
	housing via Section 8, various other HUD programs, Freddie Mac, the mortgage-
	interest tax deduction, etc.
	
Scott Sumner echoes Megan re: government-stimulated demand:

	I do feel that much of the problem reflects the fact that governments often cover 
	the cost of services in those three areas. This leads producers to spend more than
	the socially optimal amount on these products. I’m going to provide some examples,
	but before doing so recall that economic theory predicts that costs in those areas
	should be wildly excessive. If the government paid 90% of the cost of any car you
	bought, and that didn’t lead to lots more people buying Porsches and Ferraris, 
	then we’d have a major puzzle on our hands.

	Scott mentions that private for-profit hospitals are also quite expensive. But
	even there, costs are largely paid for by the government. Close to half of all 
	health care spending is directly paid for by the government (Medicare, Medicaid,
	Veterans, government employees, etc.) and a large share of the rest is indirectly
	paid for by taxpayers because health insurance is not just income tax free, but 
	also payroll tax free. I’d be stunned if health care spending had not soared in 
	recent decades.

	A sizable share of my health care spending has been unneeded, and I’m fairly
	healthy. I met one person in their 80s who had a normal cold and went to see the
	doctor. They said it was probably just a normal cold, but let’s put you in the
	hospital overnight and do some tests, just in case. There was nothing wrong, and
	the bill the next day was something in the $5000 to $10,000 range, I forget the
	exact amount. This must happen all the time. No way would they have opted for 
	those services if Medicare weren’t picking up the tab.
	
But Sumner points out that this isn't an issue in other countries where the government also pays for healthcare "so don't take this as a screed against socialized medicine":

	It’s likely the interaction of the US government picking up much of the tab, 
	plus insurance regulations, plus American-style litigation, plus powerful 
	provider lobbies that prevent European-style cost controls, etc., etc., lead
	to our unusually high cost structure. So don’t take this as a screed against 
	“socialized medicine.” I’m making a narrower point, that a country where the 
	government picks up most of the costs, and doesn’t have effective regulations 
	to hold down spending, is likely to end up with very expensive medicine.
	
Maybe the increased regulatory complexity isn't through literal regulations but fear of lawsuits? Scott says this is pretty convincing to him, since it jives with his professional experience:

	That is, might institutions add extra layers of administration and expense not because
	they’re forced to, but because they fear being sued if they don’t and then something 
	goes wrong?

	I see this all the time in medicine. A patient goes to the hospital with a heart attack.
	While he’s recovering, he tells his doctor that he’s really upset about all of this. 
	Any normal person would say “You had a heart attack, of course you’re upset, get over 
	it.” But if his doctor says this, and then a year later he commits suicide for some 
	unrelated reason, his family can sue the doctor for “not picking up the warning signs”
	and win several million dollars. So now the doctor consults a psychiatrist, who does an
	hour-long evaluation, charges the insurance company $500, and determines using her 
	immense clinical expertise that the patient is upset because he just had a heart attack.

	Those outside the field have no idea how much of medicine is built on this principle. 
	People often say that the importance of lawsuits to medical cost increases is overrated
	because malpractice insurance doesn’t cost that much, but the situation above would never
	look lawsuit-related; the whole thing only works because everyone involved documents it 
	as well-justified psychiatric consult to investigate depression. Apparently some studies
	suggest this isn’t happening, but all they do is survey doctors, and with all due respect
	all the doctors I know say the opposite.

	This has nothing to do with government regulations (except insofar as these make lawsuits
	easier or harder), but it sure can drive cost increases, and it might apply to fields 
	outside medicine as well.	
	
Stupid example of fear of lawsuits is single-engine 4-seat Cessnas, via John Schilling:

	[Fear of lawsuits] is well understood as the cause of the substantial rise in 
	light airplane prices since 1970. A single-engine, four-seat Cessna 172 cost 
	an inflation-adjusted $77,000 in 1970. A substantially identical airplane cost
	$163,000 in 1986. And went out of production the next year, because people 
	weren’t willing to pay that price. When congress passed laws relaxing the
	manufacturer’s liability for older airplanes, Cessna was able to reinstate
	production in 1996 at an inflation-adjusted $190,000. Today, the price seems
	to literally be “if you have to ask, you can’t afford it”; the manufacturer 
	only advertises fleet sales, but I’d estimate about $400,000 (of which ~$100K 
	is fancy electronics that didn’t exist in 1986 and weren’t standard in 1996).

	In this case it is particularly easy to pull out the lawsuit/liability effect 
	because there aren’t many cofounders. The 1986 Cessna is so little changed from
	the 1970 model that they sell at about the same price on the used market when 
	controlled for condition and total flight time. And fear of lawsuits didn’t 
	manifest as safety enhancements of inscrutable cost and value, because light 
	airplane crashes are almost always due to Stupid Pilot Tricks and almost
	everything that a manufacturer could do to mitigate that (e.g. tricycle landing 
	gear) was standard in 1970. But the manufacturers still get sued, and have to
	pay millions, so there’s nothing to be done but pay for liability insurance.
	And, second-order effect, cut production when your customers start balking at
	the increased prices, so you have to amortize the fixed costs of actually 
	building airplanes over a smaller sales volume.

	So, a doubling in price over fifteen or so years, a quadrupling over fifty years
	in spite of Congress noticing the problem and trying to mitigate it, attributable
	to safety/liability concerns but not resulting in actual safety improvements. I 
	have no trouble believing something similar is happening in other industries but
	is harder to discern because too many other things are happening at the same time.
	
Maybe our risk tolerance is lower?

	That is, might increased caution be due not purely to lawsuitphobia, but to really 
	caring more about whether or not people are protected? I read stuff every so often
	about how playgrounds are becoming obsolete because nobody wants to let kids run 
	around unsupervised on something with sharp edges. Suppose that one in 10,000 kids
	get a horrible playground-related injury. Is it worth making playgrounds cost twice 
	as much and be half as fun in order to decrease that number to one in 100,000? This
	isn’t a rhetorical question; I think different people can have legitimately different
	opinions here (though there are probably some utilitarian things we can do to improve
	them).

	To bring back the lawsuit point, some of this probably relates to a difference between
	personal versus institutional risk tolerance. Every so often, an elderly person 
	getting up to walk to the bathroom will fall and break their hip. This is a fact of
	life, and elderly people deal with it every day. Most elderly people I know don’t spend
	thousands of dollars fall-proofing the route from their bed to their bathroom, or
	hiring people to watch them at every moment to make sure they don’t fall, or buy a 
	bedside commode to make bathroom-related falls impossible. This suggests a revealed 
	preference that elderly people are willing to tolerate a certain fall probability in
	order to save money and convenience. Hospitals, which face huge lawsuits if any elderly
	person falls on the premises, are not willing to tolerate that probability. They put
	rails on elderly people’s beds, place alarms on them that will go off if the elderly 
	person tries to leave the bed without permission, and hire patient care assistants who 
	among other things go around carefully holding elderly people upright as they walk to 
	the bathroom (I assume this job will soon require at least a master’s degree). As more 
	things become institutionalized and the level of acceptable institutional risk tolerance
	becomes lower, this could shift the cost-risk tradeoff even if there isn’t a population-
	level trend towards more risk-aversion.	
	
An example from the playground business, via Bkearns123:

	Regarding the section on risk aversion, I happen to be in the playground business. 
	The most common injury is broken bones from a fall. Consequently, our industry has
	ended up with poured in place surfacing, which costs 10x as much as mulch or pea
	gravel. It is wonderful stuff, but really increases the cost of the playground.
	Again, no one pays directly for their playground, and the paying party cannot risk
	not being in tune with the regulations.

	Markets cannot function if the risk reward relationship is not direct.
	
Maybe things cost more for those who pay to compensate for those who don't pay?

	This is somewhat true of colleges, where an increasing number of people are getting 
	in on scholarships funded by the tuition of non-scholarship students.
	
	I haven’t been able to find great statistics on this, but one argument against: 
	couldn’t a college just not fund scholarships, and offer much lower prices to its
	paying students? I get that scholarships are good and altruistic, but it would be 
	surprising if every single college thought of its role as an altruistic institution,
	and cared about it more than they cared about providing the same service at a better 
	price. I guess this is related to my confusion about why more people don’t open up
	colleges. Maybe this is the “smart people are rightly too scared and confused to go
	to for-profit colleges, and there’s not enough ability to discriminate between the 
	good and the bad ones to make it worthwhile to found a good one” thing again.

	This also applies in health care. Our hospital (and every other hospital in the 
	country) has some “frequent flier” patients who overdose on meth at least once a week.
	They comes in, get treated for their meth overdose (we can’t legally turn away 
	emergency cases), get advised to get help for their meth addiction (without the 
	slightest expectation that they will take our advice) and then get discharged. Most 
	of them are poor and have no insurance, but each admission costs a couple of thousand
	dollars. The cost gets paid by a combination of taxpayers and other hospital patients
	with good insurance who get big markups on their own bills.
	
This essay got over a thousand comments. Here are some of the interesting ones. (I've already mentioned some above actually, whenever they overlapped with Scott's guesses.)

John Cochrane says the answer is administrative bloat:

	Things cost 10 times as much, 10 times more than they used to and 10 times more 
	than in other countries. It’s not going to wages. It’s not going to profits. So 
	where is it going?

	The unavoidable answer: The number of people it takes to produce these goods is 
	skyrocketing. Labor productivity — number of people per quality adjusted output —
	declined by a factor of 10 in these areas. It pretty much has to be that: if the
	money is not going to profits, to to each employee, it must be going to the number
	of employees.

	How can that happen? Our machines are better than ever, as Scott points out. Well,
	we (and especially we economists) pay too much attention to snazzy gadgets. 
	Productivity depends on organizations not just on gadgets. Southwest figured out
	how to turn an airplane around in 20 minutes, and it still takes United an hour.

	Contrariwise, I think we know where the extra people are. The ratio of teachers to
	students hasn’t gone down a lot — but the ratio of administrators to students has 
	shot up. Most large public school systems spend more than half their budget on
	administrators. Similarly, class sizes at most colleges and universities haven’t 
	changed that much — but administrative staff have exploded. There are 2.5 people 
	handling insurance claims for every doctor. Construction sites have always had a 
	lot of people standing around for every one actually working the machine. But now 
	for every person operating the machine there is an army of planners, regulators, 
	lawyers, administrative staff, consultants and so on.
	
Administrative bloat is an instance of a deeper issue arising in organic complex systems: technical debt. Or maybe it's related but not the same. Whatever. 

How does bloat come about? Protected monopolies:

	Regulations and law are, as Scott mentions, part of the problem. These are all 
	areas either run by the government or with large government involvement. But the 
	real key is, I think lack of competition. These are above all areas with not much
	competition. In turn, however, they are not by a long shot “natural monopolies” or 
	failure of some free market. The main effect of our regulatory and legal system is
	not so much to directly raise costs, as it is to lessen competition (that is often
	its purpose). The lack of competition leads to the cost disease.
	
	Everywhere we see businesses protected from competition, especially highly 
	regulated businesses, we see the cost disease spreading. And it spreads largely by 
	forcing companies to hire loads of useless people.

	Yes, technical regress can happen. Productivity depends as much on the functioning of 
	large organizations, and the overall legal and regulatory system in which they operate,
	as it does on gadgets. We can indeed “forget” how those work. Like our ancestors peer at
	the buildings, aqueducts, dams, roads, and bridges put up by our ancestors, whether Roman
	or American, and wonder just how they did it.
	
But Scott isn't entirely convinced:

	Any explanation of the form “administrative bloat” or “inefficiency” has to explain
	why non-bloated alternatives don’t pop up or become popular. I’m sure the CEO of Ford
	would love to just stop doing his job and approve every single funding request that
	passes his desk and pay for it by jacking up the price of cars, but at some point if
	he did that too much we’d all just buy Toyotas instead. Although there are some
	barriers to competition in the hospital market, there are fewer such barriers in the 
	college, private school, and ambulatory clinic market. Why hasn’t competition 
	discouraged administrative bloat here the same way it does in other industries?
	
David "Goodhart's law" Manheim says the answer is superior goods and the sinkholes of unclear ROI around them:

	imagine a guy who makes $40,000/year and eats chicken for dinner 3 nights a week. 
	He gets a huge 50% raise, to $60,000/year, and suddenly has extra money to spend —
	his disposable income probably tripled or quadrupled. Before the hedonic treadmill
	kicks in, and he decides to waste all the money on higher rent and nicer cars, he
	changes his diet. But he won’t start eating chicken 10 times a week — he’ll start
	eating steak. When people get more money, they replace cheap “inferior” goods with
	expensive “superior” goods. And steak is a superior good.

	But how many times a week will people eat steak? Two? Five? Americans as a whole
	got really rich in the 1940s and 1950s, and needed someplace to start spending their
	newfound wealth. What do people spend extra money on?
	
	There are only a few things that we have a limitless demand for, but very limited
	ability to judge the impact of our spending. What are they?

	I think this is one big missing piece of the puzzle; in both healthcare and 
	education, we want improvements, and they are worth a ton, but we can’t figure out
	how much the marginal spending improves things. So we pour money into these sectors.

	Scott thinks this means that teachers’ and doctors’ wages should rise, but they 
	don’t. I think it’s obvious why; they supply isn’t very limited. And the marginal
	impact of two teachers versus one, or a team of doctors versus one, isn’t huge. 
	(Class size matters, but we have tons of teachers — with no shortage in sight, there
	is no price pressure.)

	What sucks up the increased money? Dollars, both public and private, chasing hard to
	find benefits.

	I’d spend money to improve my health, both mental and physical, but how? Extra
	medical diagnostics to catch problems, pricier but marginally more effective drugs,
	chiropractors, probably useless supplements — all are exploding in popularity. How 
	much do they improve health? I don’t really know — not much, but I’d probably try
	something if it might be useful.

	I’m spending a ton of money on preschool for my kids. Why? Because it helps, according
	to the studies. How much better is the $15,000/year daycare versus the $8,000 a year
	program a friend of mine runs in her house? Unclear, but I’m certainly not the only
	one spending big bucks. Why spend less, if education is the most superior good around?

	We pour money into schools and medicine in order to improve things, but where does the
	money go? Into efforts to improve things, of course. But I’ve argued at length before
	that bureaucracy is bad at incentivizing things, especially when goals are unclear. 
	So the money goes to sinkholes like more bureaucrats and clever manipulation of the 
	metrics that are used to allocate the money.

	As long as we’re incentivized to improve things that we’re unsure how to improve, the
	incentives to pour money into them unwisely will continue, and costs will rise. 
	
Megan McArdle echoes the "sinkholes" argument re: homes, schooling and healthcare, and adds government regulation on top of it:

	Agriculture is also the focus of a great deal of government intervention, as are
	sundry things such as air travel, and we don’t see the same phenomenon there. So we 
	need to dig a little deeper and describe what’s special about these three sectors 
	(we’ll leave public transportation out of it, because there, the answer is pretty 
	much “union featherbedding combined with increasingly dysfunctional procurement and
	regulatory processes”).

	First, and most obviously, they involve vital purchases made on long time horizons,
	and with considerable uncertainty. Food is more vital than health care to our well-
	being, but its price and quality are really easy to assess: if you buy a piece of 
	fruit, you know pretty quickly whether you liked it or not. This is a robust market,
	and it’s going to take communist-level intervention to fundamentally mess it up so 
	that food is both scarce and not very good.

	Homes, schooling and health care, on the other hand, are more complicated products.
	You don’t know when you buy them how much value they will be to you, and it is often
	difficult for a lay person to assess the quality of the product. You can read hospital
	rankings and pay a home inspector, but these things only go so far.

	The fact that these are expensive purchases that can go terribly wrong creates a great
	deal of pressure for the government to intervene. As ours has, over and over, in all 
	sorts of ways.
	
Megan adds another wrinkle: America is just richer than most other countries:

	Part of that is just that we’re richer than most of those other countries. We were
	going to spend the portion of our budgets no longer needed for food somewhere, and
	health care, education and housing are pretty good candidates. But that’s only part
	of the story. A big part of the story is that America just isn’t very good at 
	regulation. When you talk to people who live elsewhere about what their government 
	does, one thing that really strikes you about those conversations is how much more 
	competent other rich industrial governments seem to be at regulating things and 
	delivering services. Their bureaucracies are not perfect, but they are better than
	ours.
	
But Scott isn't convinced:

	I think any explanation that starts with “well, we have so much money now that we 
	have to spend it on something…” ignores that many people do not have so much money, 
	and in fact are really poor, but they get the same education and health care as the 
	rest of us. If the problem were just “rich people looking for places to throw their
	money away”, there would be other options for poor people who don’t want to do that,
	the same way rich people have fancy restaurants where they can throw their money 
	away and poor people have McDonalds.
	
Anon reader says the answer is box-checking due to low institutional risk tolerance (in hedge funds at least), plus organizational complexity scaling quadratically with size (cf. HR department needing its own HR department):

	In the business I know – hedge funds – I am aware of tiny operators running perfectly 
	functional one-person shops on a shoestring, who take advantage of workarounds for 
	legal and regulatory costs (like http://www.riainabox.com/). Then there are folks like
	me who are trying to “be legit” and hope to attract the big money from pensions and 
	big banks. Those folks’ decisions are all made across major principal/agent divides 
	where agents are incentivized not to take risks. So, they force hedge funds into an 
	arms race of insanely paranoid “best practices” to compete for their money. So… my set
	up costs (which so far seem to have been too little rather than too much) were more 
	than 10x what they could have been.

	I guess this supports the “institutional risk tolerance” angle. There must be similar
	massive unseen frictions probably in many industries that go into “checking boxes”.

	Relatedly, a pet theory of mine is that “organizational complexity” imposes enormous 
	and not fully appreciated costs, which probably grow quadratically with organization 
	size. I’d predict, without Googling, that the the US military, just as a function of 
	being so large, has >75% of its personal doing effectively administrative/logistical 
	things, and that you could probably find funny examples of organizational-overhead-
	proliferation like an HR department so big it needed its own (meta-)HR department.
	
Noah Smith says the answer (along with market failures) is deceit and mistakes -- in other words, it's an informational problem; since markets aren't perfectly efficient, costs don't implicitly convey perfect information:

	There is almost certainly some level of pure trickery in the economy — people paying
	more than they should, because they don’t have the time or knowledge to look for
	better prices, or because they trust people they shouldn’t trust.

	This is the thesis of the book “Phishing for Phools,” by Nobel-winning economists
	George Akerlof and Robert Shiller. The authors advance the disturbing thesis that
	sellers will continually look for ways to dupe customers into paying more than they
	should, and that these efforts will always be partially successful. In Akerlof and
	Shiller’s reckoning, markets don’t just sometimes fail — they are inherently subject 
	to both deceit and mistakes.

	That could explain a number of unsettling empirical results in the economics 
	literature. For example, transparency reduces prices substantially in health-care 
	equipment markets. More complex and opaque mortgage-backed securities failed at higher
	rates in the financial crisis. In these and other cases, buyers paid too much because
	they didn’t know what they were buying. Whether that’s due to trickery, or to the 
	difficulty of gathering accurate information, it’s not good — in an efficient economy,
	everyone will know what they’re buying.

	So it’s possible that many of those anomalously high U.S. costs are due to the natural
	informational problems of markets.	
	
Fc123 says the answer is the resources sinkholed in each industry shifted to servicing, hence extending the definition of, the marginal customer -- from 80/20 to say 95/80. This admittedly hit me personally w.r.t. programming:

	40 years ago hospitals received 100 customers. Ranked, patients 1-20 died. And no
	one really tried to save them (some comfort but that was it). Today they are trying
	(are obliged) to try to save patients no 5-15 (the 85 year old with triple bypass,
	20 week premie). The total no of staff needed for this task swamps increases in 
	individual productivity. You just need more people, even if they each are more
	productive or trained than in the pasts. So salaries for each does not go up that 
	much, there are just more of them, total cost go up, and outcomes over the patients
	treated are somewhat but not much better (some now make it but some fraction still
	die). Hence medical curve shows some improvement but not 1:1 with cost.

	In education, in the 1950-1970s we could afford to socially promote non-academically
	inclined students, not really expend effort on them as long as they kept quiet in 
	class, then have them leave at age 16 to go work at Ford. Universities could count
	on getting the higher performing students. Today, we have to deliver much weaker 
	students all the way to the end of high school, also force many into college. And 
	ALL the extra resources go to get this new lower end close to what used to be the 
	minimal university student performance. The top cohort gets little extra resources
	and has not really improved. Hence, the scores across the new ‘extended’ student 
	population stays flat.

	I base this partly on what I have seen from my wife (engineering professor at top
	university), resources are heavily consumed by the lower performing students, top
	students have better opportunities than 20 years ago but in general the resources
	are much less focused on them than on the marginal students.

	So if you assume these industries for whatever reason shifted focus to servicing
	deeper into the tail of the population aptitude/effort over the years (I am not 
	saying this is good/bad, was for social reasons, for humanistic reasons or making
	any comment), this would very much explain the overall cost rise, coupled with the
	lack of desired improvement in statistics measured across the population that now
	gets services as a whole.

	In short, in the US we define policies that drive costs based on the tail of the 
	population, but we experience performance on the average. As an immigrant from a
	third world country I think this is a big difference often invisible to the US-born
	citizens I talk to. Maybe why this is a great country and I am here. All I can say 
	is that it is a world view that is not common world wide. Where I grew up, No Child
	Left Behind law would have been designed as 1 Child Left Behind. There just were not
	the resources, but more important, it was just more socially acceptable to just halve
	the no of slots halfway through an academic program, for example.

	So I guess the question is why are we so focused on pushing services into the tails 
	and will we continue to do so? Does society really benefit from having a larger 
	fraction of the population capable of doing crappy algebra? Clearly there will be 
	some point where the cost becomes prohibitive and it will stop: maybe that is what 
	we are seeing now. But it is stunning that this was a 50 year process — if the dynamics
	in social policy “markets” are that slow it is going to be really difficult to manage.
	
BenWave says the answer is just capitalism: the money is going to the superrich:

	A large majority of the odd features you have picked out about these services are 
	acting exactly as predicted in Das Kapital volume 2, where Marx studies the process
	of realisation of invested capital (ie, money spent on labour, materials, tools etc)
	as the principal plus surplus value in money form. In particular, some of his predictions
	were:

	1. Gains made by workers through collective action in sites of production can be taken 
	away again by the landlord, the grocer, the financier etc.

	2. The difficulty in the realisation of capital will incentivise businesses to strive 
	for monopoly positions (whether by government mandate, mutual cooperations, quasi-
	monopolies such as real estate, branding and advertising).

	3. The tensions between the production of surplus value and the realisation of surplus 
	value will tend to set certain sectors of capital against one another – for example 
	landlords would prefer if workers were well paid, but had to spend larger amounts of
	money on rent whereas factory owners would prefer to pay workers as little as possible,
	and that includes low housing costs.

	Later analysis in the tradition of Marx have noticed that financial capital these days
	is doing very very well compared to workers, but also compared to traditional 
	industrialists. And four out of the five of your examples are fields in which debt
	and financing plays a very large role. It’s pretty easy to see that financial 
	capital would be incentivised to make these things more expensive so that they can
	extract more money through larger loans and financing. (I’m not certain about subways.
	Are they typically debt-financed?).

	Financial capital certainly has the economic and political power to push for this, 
	and they don’t particularly care if they squeeze other holders of capital along they
	way. They are debt-financed fields in which large monopoly powers exist for one reason
	or another. And while I acknowledge that bureacratic bloat is certainly playing its
	role, I’m baffled by the relative lack of consideration of normal capitalist 
	tendencies on this thread. As far as I can see it is the single most important factor
	driving up the costs of these services. 
	
But Scott isn't convinced:

	Any explanation of the form “evil capitalists are scamming the rest of us for profit”
	has to explain why the cost increases are in the industries least exposed to evil 
	capitalists. K-12 education is entirely nonprofit. Colleges are a mix but generally
	not owned by a single rich guy who gets all the money. My hospital is owned by an
	order of nuns; studies show that government hospitals have higher costs than for-
	profit ones. Meanwhile, the industries with the actual evil capitalists – tech, 
	retail, restaurants, natural resources – seem mostly immune to the cost disease. 
	This is not promising. Also, this wouldn’t explain why so much of the money seems 
	to be going to administrators/bells-and-whistles. If prices increase by $100,000,
	and the money goes to hiring two extra $50,000/year administrators, how does this
	help the capitalist profiting off it all?	
	
Scott ties this back to a lot of politically contentious topics -- college tuition, teacher's unions, healthcare, public housing etc -- with a parable:

	Imagine if tomorrow, the price of water dectupled. Suddenly people have to choose 
	between drinking and washing dishes. Activists argue that taking a shower is a basic
	human right, and grumpy talk show hosts point out that in their day, parents taught 
	their children not to waste water. A coalition promotes laws ensuring government-
	subsidized free water for poor families; a Fox News investigative report shows that
	some people receiving water on the government dime are taking long luxurious showers.
	Everyone gets really angry and there’s lots of talk about basic compassion and personal
	responsibility and whatever but all of this is secondary to *why does water costs ten 
	times what it used to?*
	
How this parable applies to soaring college tuition costs:

	If we give everyone free college education, that solves a big social problem. It also 
	locks in a price which is ten times too high for no reason. This isn’t fair to the 
	government, which has to pay ten times more than it should. It’s not fair to the poor 
	people, who have to face the stigma of accepting handouts for something they could 
	easily have afforded themselves if it was at its proper price. And it’s not fair to 
	future generations if colleges take this opportunity to increase the cost by twenty 
	times, and then our children have to subsidize that.

## Framing globalization and modernity in terms of corporations
([overview](#overview))

From an old essay of Venkat's, [A Brief History of the Corporation: 1600 to 2100](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/). I briefly wondered whether to put this subsection under the "business etc" section instead, but then again this is about trying to understand globalization, so here it goes.

The corporation is viewed as an intellectual construct. In a bit more detail:

```markdown
There are some who treat corporate forms as yet another technology (in this 
case a technology of people-management), but despite the trappings of 
scientific foundations (usually in psychology) and engineering synthesis (we
speak of organizational “design”), the corporate form is not a technology. 
It is the consequence of a social contract like the one that anchors nationhood. 

It is a codified bundle of quasi-religious beliefs externalized into an animate
form that seeks to preserve itself like any other living creature.

Organizational forms represent externalized mental models, codified concepts
and structure-following-strategy (as Alfred Chandler eloquently put it)...

We are not used to viewing world history through the perspective of the 
corporation for the very good reason that corporations are a recent invention, 
and instances that had the ability to transform the world in magical ways did
not really exist till the British East India Company (EIC) was born. ...

What was new was the idea of a publicly traded joint-stock corporation, an 
entity with rights similar to those of states and individuals, with limited 
liability and significant autonomy (even in its earliest days, when corporations
were formed for defined periods of time by royal charter).
```

The impetus for writing the piece:

```markdown
For quite a while now, I have been looking for the right set of frames to get me 
started on understanding geopolitics and globalization. For a long time, I was 
misled by the fact that 90% of the available books frame globalization and the 
emergence of modernity in terms of the nation-state as the fundamental unit of 
analysis, with politics as the fundamental area of human activity that shapes 
things. On the face of it, this seems reasonable. Nominally, nation-states 
subsume economic activity, with even the most powerful multi-national 
corporations being merely secondary organizing schemes for the world.

But the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve been pulled towards a business-
first perspective on modernity and globalization.

The human world, like physics, can be reduced to four fundamental forces: culture,
politics, war and business. That is also roughly the order of decreasing strength,
increasing legibility and partial subsumption of the four forces.

Culture is the most mysterious, illegible and powerful force. It includes such 
tricky things as race, language and religion. Business, like gravity in physics, is
the weakest and most legible: it can be reduced to a few basic rules and principles
(comprehensible to high-school students) that govern the structure of the corporate
form, and descriptive artifacts like macroeconomic indicators, microeconomic
balance sheets, annual reports and stock market numbers.
```

Now that you've analogized business to gravity, you need to flesh it out:

```markdown
One quality makes gravity dominate at large space-time scales: gravity affects
all masses and is always attractive, never repulsive.  So despite its weakness,
it dominates things at sufficiently large scales. I don’t want to stretch the 
metaphor too far, but something similar holds true of business.

On the scale of days or weeks, culture, politics and war matter a lot more in
shaping our daily lives. But those forces fundamentally cancel out over longer
periods.  They are mostly noise, historically speaking. They don’t cause 
creative-destructive, unidirectional change (whether or not you think of that
change as “progress” is a different matter).

Business though, as an expression of the force of unidirectional technological
evolution, has a destabilizing unidirectional effect. It is technology, acting
through business and Schumpeterian creative-destruction, that drives monotonic,
historicist change, for good or bad. Business is the locus where the non-human
force of technological change sneaks into the human sphere.

Of course, there is arguably some progress on all four fronts. You could say 
that Shakespeare represents progress with respect to Aeschylus, and Tom 
Stoppard with respect to Shakespeare.  You could say Obama understands politics 
in ways that say, Hammurabi did not. You could say that General Petraeus thinks
of the problems of military strategy in ways that Genghis Khan did not. But all
these are decidedly weak claims.

On the other hand the proposition that Facebook (the corporation) is in some 
ways a beast entirely beyond the comprehension of an ancient Silk Road trader 
seems vastly more solid. And this is entirely a function of the intimate 
relationship between business and technology. Culture is suspicious of 
technology. Politics is mostly indifferent to and above it. War-making uses it,
but maintains an arms-length separation. Business? It gets into bed with it. 
It is sort of vaguely plausible that you could switch artists, politicians and
generals around with their peers from another age and still expect them to 
function. But there is no meaningful way for a businessman from (say) 2000 BC 
to comprehend what Mark Zuckerberg does, let alone take over for him. Too much
magical technological water has flowed under the bridge.

Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic, but technology (and science) aren’t what create 
the visible magic. Most of the magic never leaves journal papers or discarded 
engineering prototypes. It is business that creates the world of magic, not
technology itself. And the story of business in the last 400 years is the story
of the corporate form.
```

Okay, so how to understand world history (and modernity, and globalization) via the lens of the evolution of corporations? 

A corporation's reach should be distinguished from its power:

```markdown
The apogee of power did not coincide with the apogee of reach. In the 1780s, 
only a small fraction of humanity was employed by corporations, but corporations
were shaping the destinies of empires. In the centuries that followed the crash
of 1772, the power of the corporation was curtailed significantly, but in terms
of sheer reach, they continued to grow, until by around 1980, a significant 
fraction of humanity was effectively being governed by corporations.

I don’t have numbers for the whole world, but for America, less than 20% of the
population had paycheck incomes in 1780, and over 80% in 1980, and the percentage
has been declining since... Employment fraction is of course only one of the many
dimensions of corporate power (which include economic, material, cultural, human 
and political forms of power).

It is tempting to analyze corporations in terms of some measure of overall power, 
which I call “reach.” Certainly corporations today seem far more powerful than 
those of the 1700s, but the point is that the form is much weaker today, even 
though it has organized more of our lives. This is roughly the same as the 
distinction between fertility of women and population growth: the peak in 
fertility (a per-capita number) and peak in population growth rates (an 
aggregate) behave differently.
```

Making sense of world history 1500-1800 through the story of the EIC in particular and corporate mercantilism in general:

```markdown
Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and the last Muslim ruler was thrown 
out of Spain in 1492, the year Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Vasco de Gama
found a sea route to India in 1498. The three events together caused a defensive
consolidation of Islam under the later Ottomans, and an economic undermining of 
the Islamic world (a process that would directly lead to the radicalization of 
Islam under the influence of religious leaders like Abd-al Wahhab (1703-1792)).

The 16th century makes a vague sort of sense as the “Age of Exploration,” but it
really makes a lot more sense as the startup/first-mover/early-adopter phase of 
the corporate mercantilism. The period was dominated by the daring pioneer spirit 
of Spain and Portugal, which together served as the Silicon Valley of Mercantilism.
But the maritime business operations of Spain and Portugal turned out to be the 
MySpace and Friendster of Mercantilism: pioneers who could not capitalize on their
early lead.

Conventionally, it is understood that the British and the Dutch were the ones who
truly took over. But in reality, it was two corporations that took over: the EIC 
and the VOC (the Dutch East India Company,  Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, 
founded one year after the EIC) the Facebook and LinkedIn of Mercantile economics
respectively. Both were fundamentally more independent of the nation states that 
had given birth to them than any business entities in history. The EIC more so 
than the VOC.  Both eventually became complex multi-national beasts.

A lot of other stuff happened between 1600 – 1800. The names from world history are
familiar ones: Elizabeth I, Louis XIV, Akbar, the Qing emperors (the dynasty is 
better known than individual emperors) and the American Founding Fathers. The events
that come to mind are political ones: the founding of America, the English Civil 
War, the rise of the Ottomans and Mughals.

The important names in the history of the EIC are less well-known: Josiah Child,
Robert Clive, Warren Hastings. The events, like Plassey, seem like sideshows on 
the margins of land-based empires.

The British Empire lives on in memories, museums and grand monuments in two countries.
Company Raj is largely forgotten. The Leadenhall docks in London, the heart of the 
action, have disappeared today under new construction.

But arguably, the doings of the EIC and VOC on the water were more important than the 
pageantry on land.  Today the invisible web of container shipping serves as the
bloodstream of the world. Its foundations were laid by the EIC.
```

Another convenient illustration of "the rise and fall of the corporation as an idea" -- I didn't know the proportion swung back up that sharply:

![rise-fall](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/freeagents.png)

How powerful was the EIC? Unimaginable by today's standards:

```markdown
It is difficult for us in 2011, with Walmart and Facebook as examples of
corporations that significantly control our lives, to understand the sheer 
power the East India Company exercised during its heyday. Power that makes 
even the most out-of-control of today’s corporations seem tame by comparison.
To a large extent, the history of the first 200 years of corporate evolution
is the history of the East India Company. And despite its name and nation of
origin, to think of it as a corporation that helped Britain rule India is to
entirely misunderstand the nature of the beast.

Two images hint at its actual globe-straddling, 10x-Walmart influence: the
image of the Boston Tea Partiers dumping crates of tea into the sea during the
American struggle for independence, and the image of smoky opium dens in China.
One image symbolizes the rise of a new empire. The other marks the decline of 
an old one.

The East India Company supplied both the tea and the opium.

At a broader level, the EIC managed to balance an unbalanced trade equation 
between Europe and Asia whose solution had eluded even the Roman empire.
Massive flows of gold and silver from Europe to Asia via the Silk and Spice 
routes had been a given in world trade for several thousand years. Asia 
simply had far more to sell than it wanted to buy. Until the EIC came along.

A very rough sketch of how the EIC solved the equation reveals the structure
of value-addition in the mercantilist world economy.

The EIC started out by buying textiles from Bengal and tea from China in 
exchange for gold and silver.

Then it realized it was playing the same sucker game that had trapped and helped 
bankrupt Rome.

Next, it figured out that it could take control of the opium industry in Bengal,
trade opium for tea in China with a significant surplus, and use the money to 
buy the textiles it needed in Bengal. Guns would be needed.

As a bonus, along with its partners, it participated in yet another clever trade:
textiles for slaves along the coast of Africa, who could be sold in America for
gold and silver.

For this scheme to work, three foreground things and one background thing had 
to happen: the corporation had to effectively take over Bengal (and eventually 
all of India), Hong Kong (and eventually, all of China, indirectly) and England.
Robert Clive achieved the first goal by 1757. An employee of the EIC, William 
Jardine, founded what is today Jardine Matheson, the spinoff corporation most 
associated with Hong Kong and the historic opium trade. It was, during in its 
early history, what we would call today a narco-terrorist corporation; the Taliban
today are kindergarteners in that game by comparison. And while the corporation 
never actually took control of the British Crown, it came close several times, by
financing the government during its many troubles.

The background development was simpler. England had to take over the oceans and 
ensure the safe operations of the EIC.

Just how comprehensively did the EIC control the affairs of states? Bengal is an 
excellent example. In the 1600s and the first half of the 1700s, before the
Industrial Revolution, Bengali textiles were the dominant note in the giant sucking
sound drawing away European wealth (which was flowing from the mines and farms of 
the Americas). The European market, once the EIC had shoved the Dutch VOC aside, 
constantly demanded more and more of an increasing variety of textiles, ignoring the 
complaining of its own weavers. Initially, the company did no more than battle the
Dutch and Portuguese on water, and negotiate agreements to set up trading posts on
land. For a while, it played by the rules of the Mughal empire and its intricate 
system of economic control based on various imperial decrees and permissions. The 
Mughal system kept the business world firmly subservient to the political class, 
and ensured a level playing field for all traders. Bengal in the 17th and 18th 
centuries was a cheerful drama of Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Indians, Chinese and 
Europeans. Trade in the key commodities, textiles, opium, saltpeter and betel nuts,
was carefully managed to keep the empire on top.

But eventually, as the threat from the Dutch was tamed, it became clear that the 
company actually had more firepower at its disposal than most of the nation-states 
it was dealing with. The realization led to the first big domino falling, in the 
corporate colonization of India, at the battle of Plassey. Robert Clive along with
Indian co-conspirators managed to take over Bengal, appoint a puppet Nawab, and get
himself appointed as the Mughal diwan (finance minister/treasurer) of the province 
of Bengal, charged with tax collection and economic administration on behalf of the 
weakened Mughals, who were busy destroying their empire. Even people who are familiar
enough with world history to recognize the name Robert Clive rarely understand the 
extent to which this was the act of a single sociopath within a dangerously unregulated 
corporation, rather than the country it was nominally subservient to (England).

This history doesn’t really stand out in sharp relief until you contrast it with the
behavior of modern corporations. Today, we listen with shock to rumors about the
backroom influence of corporations like Halliburton or BP, and politicians being in
bed with the business leaders in the Too-Big-to-Fail companies they are supposed to
regulate.

The EIC was the original too-big-to-fail corporation. The EIC was the beneficiary of
the original Big Bailout. Before there was TARP, there was the Tea Act of 1773 and 
the Pitt India Act of 1783. The former was a failed attempt to rein in the EIC, which
cost Britain the American Colonies.  The latter created the British Raj as Britain 
doubled down in the east to recover from its losses in the west. An invisible thread
connects the histories of India and America at this point. Lord Cornwallis, the loser
at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781 during the revolutionary war, became the second
Governor General of India in 1786.

But these events were set in motion over 30 years earlier, in the 1750s. There was no 
need for backroom subterfuge.  It was all out in the open because the corporation was
such a new beast, nobody really understood the dangers it represented. The EIC
maintained an army. Its merchant ships often carried vastly more firepower than the
naval ships of lesser nations. Its officers were not only not prevented from making
money on the side, private trade was actually a perk of employment (it was exactly this
perk that allowed William Jardine to start a rival business that took over the China 
trade in the EIC’s old age).  And finally — the cherry on the sundae — there was 
nothing preventing its officers like Clive from simultaneously holding political 
appointments that legitimized conflicts of interest. If you thought it was bad enough 
that Dick Cheney used to work for Halliburton before he took office, imagine if he’d 
worked there while in office, with legitimate authority to use his government power 
to favor his corporate employer and make as much money on the side as he wanted, and
call in the Army and Navy to enforce his will. That picture gives you an idea of the
position Robert Clive found himself in, in 1757.

He made out like a bandit. A full 150 years before American corporate barons earned 
the appellation “robber.”

## Critique of Freakonomics
([overview](#overview))

From Daniel Davies' [review](https://blog.danieldavies.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113336769665072876). The chief problem is "the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers":

```markdown
There are a number of things I don't like about Levitt's approach, but the biggest problem I have with
him is his[2] habit of saying (in various forms of words) "whichever way you look at the numbers, XYZ" 
when he means "whichever way I look at the numbers, XYZ". On a lot of these subjects (by far the most 
obvious example is abortion/crime, but it is an issue in all of them to a greater or lesser degree), 
Levitt is looking at quite large, clearly multicausal issues where any model is likely to be partial and
all manner of conflicting theories can claim support from the data. "Freakonomics" absolutely does not
recognize this fundamental truth of econometrics; it might be because the authors don't have the 
statistical chops to understand it but I think it is much more likely that they are just trying to copy 
the monolithic tone of voice adopted by social reformers and similar blowhards who hand out their 
assertions with no data at all. In all honesty, I think that theL&D approach is a retrograde step; it's
easy for the untrained reader to spot when someone has no empirical support at all for his position, but
much more difficult to deal with someone who systematically overstates the empirical support that he does
have. This is at least 90% of what makes John Lott so pernicious, and it seems to me that L&D are involved
at least partly in the same sort of game.

It's the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers. There are 
lots of people in this space, and not all of it is by any means bad. Any look at a difficult question is
going to be either hopelessly oversimplified or hopelessly unreadable, and I would certainly prefer it if
people erred in the first direction. There's also a decent Hayekian (or indeed Bayesian) point to be made
here that if you're entering into the marketplace of ideas to try and extract the truth from a number of 
differing viewpoints, then you want everyone to give you their idea, not to caveat it all about with bits 
and pieces of other people's ideas. That's why I'm prepared to give a (limited) free pass to Malcolm Gladwell 
or James Surowiecki when they write books like this which, in my view, present absurdly oversimplified views
of the world, because I understand what they're trying to do; to present their view on a question, not to 
give the final indisputable answer.

The problem comes in when someone attempts to present their view of a question as if it is the final
indisputable answer. A lot of the things in Freakonomics are things that I wouldn't make too much of a fuss
about if the authors were just advancing them as their view of one way of explaining the facts. But they
don't do that; at key points in the book, they keep claiming that they're reporting the facts when they're 
clearly (to me at least) reporting a particular spin on the facts. This is the pop-science approach to social
questions, because it's trying to combine the authority of a scientific investigation with the unequivocal 
certainty of a theoretical pronouncement. What Levitt and Dubner are doing is exactly the same thing that 
Thomas Friedman does; telling a bunch of stories and then explaining how these stories fit into their view of 
the world. However, in the case of Friedman it's always obvious that someone else could tell entirely
different stories about the same kinds of people and events and fit them into an entirely different worldview.
Because of the way that Freakonomics has pitched itself at the pop-science crowd (constantly banging on about
Levitt's John Bates Clark medal and referring to all the statistical analyses; for fans of cringeworthy 
exegesis, page 161 of the American edition contains what I strongly believe to be the worst description of the 
linear regression model ever committed to print), however, they are always either implying or outright saying
that their stories are the only ones consistent with the facts, so we can either fit their stylized facts into 
our own worldview or (preferably) drop ours and buy theirs. As you can tell, I don't like this.
```

Example Freakonomism: "the typical prostitute earns more than the typical architect". Davies says:

```markdown
This remark is asinine. What on earth are they talking about? There is probably a reasonable working 
definition of a "typical architect" (though I can think of about five different types of architect off 
the top of my head), but what is a "typical prostitute"? Do they mean per hour or on an average annual
earnings basis? Is there any data to back this up (the only study I could find put average earnings for 
street prostitutes in Los Angeles, who are about as "typical" as any other prostitutes at $23485 in 1991,
which seems low for an architect)? 

Fair enough, this is really just a throwaway remark aimed at illustrating a point about labour market 
theory, but surely the whole freakonomicsing selling point of this book was meant to be that the authors
didn't make lazy assumptions and throwaway remarks but checked things against the data. I'm sorry, but if
a bloke says "of course, prostitutes make a mint, they do, they earn much more than you or I", then in my
estimation it is going to count very much against his subsequent claim to never take things on trust or 
to tirelessly question conventional wisdom.
```

Another example, concerning swimming pools and guns:

```markdown
As presented in the book, the argument is obviously wrong. Levitt divides the number of child deaths 
caused by guns by the number of guns, then divides the number of child deaths caused by swimming pools 
by the number of swimming pools, compares the two numbers and says "if you have a gun in your house and
a swimming pool, the pool is more likely to kill your child than the gun". 

Which might or might not be true, but this calculation can't possibly be the right way to prove it. Riddle
me this; what proportion of the guns in the USA are held in households with no children in them? What
proportion of the swimming pools in the US are owned by households with no children in them? Is there 
perhaps a pretty good reason to believe that households which differ in their gun ownership and 
swimming-pool ownership will also differ in other potentially relevant ways? Is there a good reason to 
believe that the fact that a house has a child in it will be informative about the relative likelihood of
gun ownership and pool ownership? Now, Levitt might, for all I know, have actually done the more rigorous
analytic work which would support his claim here. But if he did, I bet he did it in a proper journal where
he stated the claim with the proper caveats and was totally clear about the degree of confidence that could 
be placed in it. But that's not what he does in "Freakonomics". He just a) puts the factoid straight in 
front of the reader with no qualifications at all and b) backs it up with a calculation that is clearly
flat out wrong. He's simultaneously teaching the lay reader to make definitive statements without
acknowledging estimation problems, and to ignore correlations between explanatory variables. How on earth 
can this not be worsening the overall level of debate?

## Chinese perspective on Western elite
([overview](#overview))

I love how Puzhong Yao comes across in his essay [The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/), about his experiences at Goldman Sachs, Cambridge and Stanford. He’s so honest and straight-laced he reminds me of myself before I ‘got more sophisticated’ in order to ‘navigate the turbulent realities of daily workplace politics’ (well, minimally, so I don’t drown). Here are some quotes I especially liked.

Result over process:

```markdown
My job at Goldman was a mixture of making markets to facilitate client trades and finding trades
for the bank’s own book. In early 2009, I believed it was an excellent trade to go long UK 
inflation. In fact, I thought it was such a good trade that my biggest worry was that there 
wouldn’t be anyone who would want to be on the other side of it. Yet we managed to put this
trade on versus a British bank. In the following year, the trade worked wonders, with UK 
inflation steadily rising, making the bank tens of millions in profits.

I thought I was an amazing trader. But there was a slight problem: I wanted to do the trade 
because I thought the market was pricing UK interest rates to go up. And when interest rates go 
up, UK inflation would rise mechanically due to the way it is defined and calculated. But in that
year, the Bank of England didn’t raise interest rates at all. Rather, the increase in inflation 
was due to things like tax increases, exchange rate fluctuations, oil price moves, etc.—things I
didn’t anticipate at all. It was pure luck that I made money, and I made it for the wrong reason.

When I was an intern, in one of the training presentations, a senior banker told us to distinguish
between the process and the results. He said that we should focus on the process, which we can
control, rather than the result, which is subject to luck. And here at Goldman, he said, we don’t
punish people for losing money for the right reason. I have always loved asking questions, so I 
asked him, was anyone ever punished for making money for the wrong reason? After giving it some
thought, he said that he had not heard of any such thing. And he was right. In fact, no one seemed
to remember the reason I did the inflation trade at all. They only remembered that I did this trade
and that it worked well.

When I met with my manager for a performance review after this, I was expecting to be berated for
my poor judgment. Instead, I got promoted! I told my manager that it was a mistake, but he merely
said, “Puzhong, tell no one.” He too was promoted on the basis of managing my “brilliant” trade. 
In fact, my manager was so proud of my work he recommended me to Stanford’s prestigious Graduate 
School of Business (GSB), and I soon set off for America.
```

Mottos as an example of Robin Hanson's "X isn't about Y":

```markdown
One class was about strategy. It focused on how corporate mottos and logos could inspire employees.
Many of the students had worked for nonprofits or health care or tech companies, all of which had 
mottos about changing the world, saving lives, saving the planet, etc. The professor seemed to like
these mottos.

I told him that at Goldman our motto was “be long-term greedy.” The professor couldn’t understand
this motto or why it was inspiring. I explained to him that everyone else in the market was short-term 
greedy and, as a result, we took all their money. Since traders like money, this was inspiring.

He asked if perhaps there was another motto or logo that my other classmates might connect with. I
told him about the black swan I kept on my desk as a reminder that low probability events happen with
high frequency.

He didn’t like that motto either and decided to call on another student, who had worked at Pfizer. 
Their motto was “all people deserve to live healthy lives.” The professor thought this was much better.

I didn’t understand how it would motivate employees, but this was exactly why I had come to Stanford:
to learn the key lessons of interpersonal communication and leadership.
```

On the importance of showing that you feel strongly about something, else it shows you aren't taking it seriously:

```markdown
On the communication and leadership front, I came to the GSB knowing I was not good and hoped to 
get better. My favorite class was called “Interpersonal Dynamics” or, as students referred to it,
“Touchy Feely.” In “Touchy Feely,” students get very candid feedback on how their words and actions 
affect others in a small group that meets several hours per week for a whole quarter.

We talked about microaggressions and feelings and empathy and listening. Sometimes in class the 
professor would say things to me like “Puzhong, when Mary said that, I could see you were really 
feeling something,” or “Puzhong, I could see in your eyes that Peter’s story affected you.” And I 
would tell them I didn’t feel anything. I was quite confused.

One of the papers we studied mentioned that subjects are often not conscious of their own feelings 
when fully immersed in a situation. But body indicators such as heart rate would show whether the 
person is experiencing strong emotions. I thought that I generally didn’t have a lot of emotions and
decided that this might be a good way for me to discover my hidden emotions that the professor kept
asking about.

So I bought a heart rate monitor and checked my resting heart rate. Right around 78. And when the 
professor said to me in class “Puzhong, I can see that story brought up some emotions in you,” I
rolled up my sleeve and checked my heart rate. It was about 77. And so I said, “nope, no emotion.” 
The experiment seemed to confirm my prior belief: my heart rate hardly moved, even when I was
criticized, though it did jump when I became excited or laughed.

This didn’t land well on some of my classmates. They felt I was not treating these matters with the
seriousness that they deserved. The professor was very angry. My takeaway was that my interpersonal
skills were so bad that I could easily offend people unintentionally, so I concluded that after 
graduation I should do something that involved as little human interaction as possible.
```
