## What is this?

This is the "economics, globalization and political science" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

Relatedly, I aspire towards the vision Tiago Forte fleshes out in his [digital notes as second brain essay](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/edit/master/notes-memory-cognition-teaching-learning.md#Offload-thinking-to-second-brain).

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Framing globalization and modernity in terms of corporations
([overview](#overview))

From an old essay of Venkat's, [A Brief History of the Corporation: 1600 to 2100](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/). I briefly wondered whether to put this subsection under the "business etc" section instead, but then again this is about trying to understand globalization, so here it goes.

The corporation is viewed as an intellectual construct. In a bit more detail:

```markdown
There are some who treat corporate forms as yet another technology (in this 
case a technology of people-management), but despite the trappings of 
scientific foundations (usually in psychology) and engineering synthesis (we
speak of organizational “design”), the corporate form is not a technology. 
It is the consequence of a social contract like the one that anchors nationhood. 

It is a codified bundle of quasi-religious beliefs externalized into an animate
form that seeks to preserve itself like any other living creature.

Organizational forms represent externalized mental models, codified concepts
and structure-following-strategy (as Alfred Chandler eloquently put it)...

We are not used to viewing world history through the perspective of the 
corporation for the very good reason that corporations are a recent invention, 
and instances that had the ability to transform the world in magical ways did
not really exist till the British East India Company (EIC) was born. ...

What was new was the idea of a publicly traded joint-stock corporation, an 
entity with rights similar to those of states and individuals, with limited 
liability and significant autonomy (even in its earliest days, when corporations
were formed for defined periods of time by royal charter).
```

The impetus for writing the piece:

```markdown
For quite a while now, I have been looking for the right set of frames to get me 
started on understanding geopolitics and globalization. For a long time, I was 
misled by the fact that 90% of the available books frame globalization and the 
emergence of modernity in terms of the nation-state as the fundamental unit of 
analysis, with politics as the fundamental area of human activity that shapes 
things. On the face of it, this seems reasonable. Nominally, nation-states 
subsume economic activity, with even the most powerful multi-national 
corporations being merely secondary organizing schemes for the world.

But the more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve been pulled towards a business-
first perspective on modernity and globalization.

The human world, like physics, can be reduced to four fundamental forces: culture,
politics, war and business. That is also roughly the order of decreasing strength,
increasing legibility and partial subsumption of the four forces.

Culture is the most mysterious, illegible and powerful force. It includes such 
tricky things as race, language and religion. Business, like gravity in physics, is
the weakest and most legible: it can be reduced to a few basic rules and principles
(comprehensible to high-school students) that govern the structure of the corporate
form, and descriptive artifacts like macroeconomic indicators, microeconomic
balance sheets, annual reports and stock market numbers.
```

Convenient illustration:

![four-forces-human-world](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fourForces.png)

Now that you've analogized business to gravity, you need to flesh it out:

```markdown
One quality makes gravity dominate at large space-time scales: gravity affects
all masses and is always attractive, never repulsive.  So despite its weakness,
it dominates things at sufficiently large scales. I don’t want to stretch the 
metaphor too far, but something similar holds true of business.

On the scale of days or weeks, culture, politics and war matter a lot more in
shaping our daily lives. But those forces fundamentally cancel out over longer
periods.  They are mostly noise, historically speaking. They don’t cause 
creative-destructive, unidirectional change (whether or not you think of that
change as “progress” is a different matter).

Business though, as an expression of the force of unidirectional technological
evolution, has a destabilizing unidirectional effect. It is technology, acting
through business and Schumpeterian creative-destruction, that drives monotonic,
historicist change, for good or bad. Business is the locus where the non-human
force of technological change sneaks into the human sphere.

Of course, there is arguably some progress on all four fronts. You could say 
that Shakespeare represents progress with respect to Aeschylus, and Tom 
Stoppard with respect to Shakespeare.  You could say Obama understands politics 
in ways that say, Hammurabi did not. You could say that General Petraeus thinks
of the problems of military strategy in ways that Genghis Khan did not. But all
these are decidedly weak claims.

On the other hand the proposition that Facebook (the corporation) is in some 
ways a beast entirely beyond the comprehension of an ancient Silk Road trader 
seems vastly more solid. And this is entirely a function of the intimate 
relationship between business and technology. Culture is suspicious of 
technology. Politics is mostly indifferent to and above it. War-making uses it,
but maintains an arms-length separation. Business? It gets into bed with it. 
It is sort of vaguely plausible that you could switch artists, politicians and
generals around with their peers from another age and still expect them to 
function. But there is no meaningful way for a businessman from (say) 2000 BC 
to comprehend what Mark Zuckerberg does, let alone take over for him. Too much
magical technological water has flowed under the bridge.

Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic, but technology (and science) aren’t what create 
the visible magic. Most of the magic never leaves journal papers or discarded 
engineering prototypes. It is business that creates the world of magic, not
technology itself. And the story of business in the last 400 years is the story
of the corporate form.
```

Okay, so how to understand world history (and modernity, and globalization) via the lens of the evolution of corporations? 

A corporation's reach should be distinguished from its power:

```markdown
The apogee of power did not coincide with the apogee of reach. In the 1780s, 
only a small fraction of humanity was employed by corporations, but corporations
were shaping the destinies of empires. In the centuries that followed the crash
of 1772, the power of the corporation was curtailed significantly, but in terms
of sheer reach, they continued to grow, until by around 1980, a significant 
fraction of humanity was effectively being governed by corporations.

I don’t have numbers for the whole world, but for America, less than 20% of the
population had paycheck incomes in 1780, and over 80% in 1980, and the percentage
has been declining since... Employment fraction is of course only one of the many
dimensions of corporate power (which include economic, material, cultural, human 
and political forms of power).

It is tempting to analyze corporations in terms of some measure of overall power, 
which I call “reach.” Certainly corporations today seem far more powerful than 
those of the 1700s, but the point is that the form is much weaker today, even 
though it has organized more of our lives. This is roughly the same as the 
distinction between fertility of women and population growth: the peak in 
fertility (a per-capita number) and peak in population growth rates (an 
aggregate) behave differently.
```

Making sense of world history 1500-1800 through the story of the EIC in particular and corporate mercantilism in general:

```markdown
Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 and the last Muslim ruler was thrown 
out of Spain in 1492, the year Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Vasco de Gama
found a sea route to India in 1498. The three events together caused a defensive
consolidation of Islam under the later Ottomans, and an economic undermining of 
the Islamic world (a process that would directly lead to the radicalization of 
Islam under the influence of religious leaders like Abd-al Wahhab (1703-1792)).

The 16th century makes a vague sort of sense as the “Age of Exploration,” but it
really makes a lot more sense as the startup/first-mover/early-adopter phase of 
the corporate mercantilism. The period was dominated by the daring pioneer spirit 
of Spain and Portugal, which together served as the Silicon Valley of Mercantilism.
But the maritime business operations of Spain and Portugal turned out to be the 
MySpace and Friendster of Mercantilism: pioneers who could not capitalize on their
early lead.

Conventionally, it is understood that the British and the Dutch were the ones who
truly took over. But in reality, it was two corporations that took over: the EIC 
and the VOC (the Dutch East India Company,  Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, 
founded one year after the EIC) the Facebook and LinkedIn of Mercantile economics
respectively. Both were fundamentally more independent of the nation states that 
had given birth to them than any business entities in history. The EIC more so 
than the VOC.  Both eventually became complex multi-national beasts.

A lot of other stuff happened between 1600 – 1800. The names from world history are
familiar ones: Elizabeth I, Louis XIV, Akbar, the Qing emperors (the dynasty is 
better known than individual emperors) and the American Founding Fathers. The events
that come to mind are political ones: the founding of America, the English Civil 
War, the rise of the Ottomans and Mughals.

The important names in the history of the EIC are less well-known: Josiah Child,
Robert Clive, Warren Hastings. The events, like Plassey, seem like sideshows on 
the margins of land-based empires.

The British Empire lives on in memories, museums and grand monuments in two countries.
Company Raj is largely forgotten. The Leadenhall docks in London, the heart of the 
action, have disappeared today under new construction.

But arguably, the doings of the EIC and VOC on the water were more important than the 
pageantry on land.  Today the invisible web of container shipping serves as the
bloodstream of the world. Its foundations were laid by the EIC.
```

Another convenient illustration of "the rise and fall of the corporation as an idea" -- I didn't know the proportion swung back up that sharply:

![rise-fall](https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/freeagents.png)

How powerful was the EIC? Unimaginable by today's standards:

```markdown
It is difficult for us in 2011, with Walmart and Facebook as examples of
corporations that significantly control our lives, to understand the sheer 
power the East India Company exercised during its heyday. Power that makes 
even the most out-of-control of today’s corporations seem tame by comparison.
To a large extent, the history of the first 200 years of corporate evolution
is the history of the East India Company. And despite its name and nation of
origin, to think of it as a corporation that helped Britain rule India is to
entirely misunderstand the nature of the beast.

Two images hint at its actual globe-straddling, 10x-Walmart influence: the
image of the Boston Tea Partiers dumping crates of tea into the sea during the
American struggle for independence, and the image of smoky opium dens in China.
One image symbolizes the rise of a new empire. The other marks the decline of 
an old one.

The East India Company supplied both the tea and the opium.

At a broader level, the EIC managed to balance an unbalanced trade equation 
between Europe and Asia whose solution had eluded even the Roman empire.
Massive flows of gold and silver from Europe to Asia via the Silk and Spice 
routes had been a given in world trade for several thousand years. Asia 
simply had far more to sell than it wanted to buy. Until the EIC came along.

A very rough sketch of how the EIC solved the equation reveals the structure
of value-addition in the mercantilist world economy.

The EIC started out by buying textiles from Bengal and tea from China in 
exchange for gold and silver.

Then it realized it was playing the same sucker game that had trapped and helped 
bankrupt Rome.

Next, it figured out that it could take control of the opium industry in Bengal,
trade opium for tea in China with a significant surplus, and use the money to 
buy the textiles it needed in Bengal. Guns would be needed.

As a bonus, along with its partners, it participated in yet another clever trade:
textiles for slaves along the coast of Africa, who could be sold in America for
gold and silver.

For this scheme to work, three foreground things and one background thing had 
to happen: the corporation had to effectively take over Bengal (and eventually 
all of India), Hong Kong (and eventually, all of China, indirectly) and England.
Robert Clive achieved the first goal by 1757. An employee of the EIC, William 
Jardine, founded what is today Jardine Matheson, the spinoff corporation most 
associated with Hong Kong and the historic opium trade. It was, during in its 
early history, what we would call today a narco-terrorist corporation; the Taliban
today are kindergarteners in that game by comparison. And while the corporation 
never actually took control of the British Crown, it came close several times, by
financing the government during its many troubles.

The background development was simpler. England had to take over the oceans and 
ensure the safe operations of the EIC.

Just how comprehensively did the EIC control the affairs of states? Bengal is an 
excellent example. In the 1600s and the first half of the 1700s, before the
Industrial Revolution, Bengali textiles were the dominant note in the giant sucking
sound drawing away European wealth (which was flowing from the mines and farms of 
the Americas). The European market, once the EIC had shoved the Dutch VOC aside, 
constantly demanded more and more of an increasing variety of textiles, ignoring the 
complaining of its own weavers. Initially, the company did no more than battle the
Dutch and Portuguese on water, and negotiate agreements to set up trading posts on
land. For a while, it played by the rules of the Mughal empire and its intricate 
system of economic control based on various imperial decrees and permissions. The 
Mughal system kept the business world firmly subservient to the political class, 
and ensured a level playing field for all traders. Bengal in the 17th and 18th 
centuries was a cheerful drama of Turks, Arabs, Armenians, Indians, Chinese and 
Europeans. Trade in the key commodities, textiles, opium, saltpeter and betel nuts,
was carefully managed to keep the empire on top.

But eventually, as the threat from the Dutch was tamed, it became clear that the 
company actually had more firepower at its disposal than most of the nation-states 
it was dealing with. The realization led to the first big domino falling, in the 
corporate colonization of India, at the battle of Plassey. Robert Clive along with
Indian co-conspirators managed to take over Bengal, appoint a puppet Nawab, and get
himself appointed as the Mughal diwan (finance minister/treasurer) of the province 
of Bengal, charged with tax collection and economic administration on behalf of the 
weakened Mughals, who were busy destroying their empire. Even people who are familiar
enough with world history to recognize the name Robert Clive rarely understand the 
extent to which this was the act of a single sociopath within a dangerously unregulated 
corporation, rather than the country it was nominally subservient to (England).

This history doesn’t really stand out in sharp relief until you contrast it with the
behavior of modern corporations. Today, we listen with shock to rumors about the
backroom influence of corporations like Halliburton or BP, and politicians being in
bed with the business leaders in the Too-Big-to-Fail companies they are supposed to
regulate.

The EIC was the original too-big-to-fail corporation. The EIC was the beneficiary of
the original Big Bailout. Before there was TARP, there was the Tea Act of 1773 and 
the Pitt India Act of 1783. The former was a failed attempt to rein in the EIC, which
cost Britain the American Colonies.  The latter created the British Raj as Britain 
doubled down in the east to recover from its losses in the west. An invisible thread
connects the histories of India and America at this point. Lord Cornwallis, the loser
at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781 during the revolutionary war, became the second
Governor General of India in 1786.

But these events were set in motion over 30 years earlier, in the 1750s. There was no 
need for backroom subterfuge.  It was all out in the open because the corporation was
such a new beast, nobody really understood the dangers it represented. The EIC
maintained an army. Its merchant ships often carried vastly more firepower than the
naval ships of lesser nations. Its officers were not only not prevented from making
money on the side, private trade was actually a perk of employment (it was exactly this
perk that allowed William Jardine to start a rival business that took over the China 
trade in the EIC’s old age).  And finally — the cherry on the sundae — there was 
nothing preventing its officers like Clive from simultaneously holding political 
appointments that legitimized conflicts of interest. If you thought it was bad enough 
that Dick Cheney used to work for Halliburton before he took office, imagine if he’d 
worked there while in office, with legitimate authority to use his government power 
to favor his corporate employer and make as much money on the side as he wanted, and
call in the Army and Navy to enforce his will. That picture gives you an idea of the
position Robert Clive found himself in, in 1757.

He made out like a bandit. A full 150 years before American corporate barons earned 
the appellation “robber.”

## Critique of Freakonomics
([overview](#overview))

From Daniel Davies' [review](https://blog.danieldavies.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113336769665072876). The chief problem is "the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers":

```markdown
There are a number of things I don't like about Levitt's approach, but the biggest problem I have with
him is his[2] habit of saying (in various forms of words) "whichever way you look at the numbers, XYZ" 
when he means "whichever way I look at the numbers, XYZ". On a lot of these subjects (by far the most 
obvious example is abortion/crime, but it is an issue in all of them to a greater or lesser degree), 
Levitt is looking at quite large, clearly multicausal issues where any model is likely to be partial and
all manner of conflicting theories can claim support from the data. "Freakonomics" absolutely does not
recognize this fundamental truth of econometrics; it might be because the authors don't have the 
statistical chops to understand it but I think it is much more likely that they are just trying to copy 
the monolithic tone of voice adopted by social reformers and similar blowhards who hand out their 
assertions with no data at all. In all honesty, I think that theL&D approach is a retrograde step; it's
easy for the untrained reader to spot when someone has no empirical support at all for his position, but
much more difficult to deal with someone who systematically overstates the empirical support that he does
have. This is at least 90% of what makes John Lott so pernicious, and it seems to me that L&D are involved
at least partly in the same sort of game.

It's the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers. There are 
lots of people in this space, and not all of it is by any means bad. Any look at a difficult question is
going to be either hopelessly oversimplified or hopelessly unreadable, and I would certainly prefer it if
people erred in the first direction. There's also a decent Hayekian (or indeed Bayesian) point to be made
here that if you're entering into the marketplace of ideas to try and extract the truth from a number of 
differing viewpoints, then you want everyone to give you their idea, not to caveat it all about with bits 
and pieces of other people's ideas. That's why I'm prepared to give a (limited) free pass to Malcolm Gladwell 
or James Surowiecki when they write books like this which, in my view, present absurdly oversimplified views
of the world, because I understand what they're trying to do; to present their view on a question, not to 
give the final indisputable answer.

The problem comes in when someone attempts to present their view of a question as if it is the final
indisputable answer. A lot of the things in Freakonomics are things that I wouldn't make too much of a fuss
about if the authors were just advancing them as their view of one way of explaining the facts. But they
don't do that; at key points in the book, they keep claiming that they're reporting the facts when they're 
clearly (to me at least) reporting a particular spin on the facts. This is the pop-science approach to social
questions, because it's trying to combine the authority of a scientific investigation with the unequivocal 
certainty of a theoretical pronouncement. What Levitt and Dubner are doing is exactly the same thing that 
Thomas Friedman does; telling a bunch of stories and then explaining how these stories fit into their view of 
the world. However, in the case of Friedman it's always obvious that someone else could tell entirely
different stories about the same kinds of people and events and fit them into an entirely different worldview.
Because of the way that Freakonomics has pitched itself at the pop-science crowd (constantly banging on about
Levitt's John Bates Clark medal and referring to all the statistical analyses; for fans of cringeworthy 
exegesis, page 161 of the American edition contains what I strongly believe to be the worst description of the 
linear regression model ever committed to print), however, they are always either implying or outright saying
that their stories are the only ones consistent with the facts, so we can either fit their stylized facts into 
our own worldview or (preferably) drop ours and buy theirs. As you can tell, I don't like this.
```

Example Freakonomism: "the typical prostitute earns more than the typical architect". Davies says:

```markdown
This remark is asinine. What on earth are they talking about? There is probably a reasonable working 
definition of a "typical architect" (though I can think of about five different types of architect off 
the top of my head), but what is a "typical prostitute"? Do they mean per hour or on an average annual
earnings basis? Is there any data to back this up (the only study I could find put average earnings for 
street prostitutes in Los Angeles, who are about as "typical" as any other prostitutes at $23485 in 1991,
which seems low for an architect)? 

Fair enough, this is really just a throwaway remark aimed at illustrating a point about labour market 
theory, but surely the whole freakonomicsing selling point of this book was meant to be that the authors
didn't make lazy assumptions and throwaway remarks but checked things against the data. I'm sorry, but if
a bloke says "of course, prostitutes make a mint, they do, they earn much more than you or I", then in my
estimation it is going to count very much against his subsequent claim to never take things on trust or 
to tirelessly question conventional wisdom.
```

Another example, concerning swimming pools and guns:

```markdown
As presented in the book, the argument is obviously wrong. Levitt divides the number of child deaths 
caused by guns by the number of guns, then divides the number of child deaths caused by swimming pools 
by the number of swimming pools, compares the two numbers and says "if you have a gun in your house and
a swimming pool, the pool is more likely to kill your child than the gun". 

Which might or might not be true, but this calculation can't possibly be the right way to prove it. Riddle
me this; what proportion of the guns in the USA are held in households with no children in them? What
proportion of the swimming pools in the US are owned by households with no children in them? Is there 
perhaps a pretty good reason to believe that households which differ in their gun ownership and 
swimming-pool ownership will also differ in other potentially relevant ways? Is there a good reason to 
believe that the fact that a house has a child in it will be informative about the relative likelihood of
gun ownership and pool ownership? Now, Levitt might, for all I know, have actually done the more rigorous
analytic work which would support his claim here. But if he did, I bet he did it in a proper journal where
he stated the claim with the proper caveats and was totally clear about the degree of confidence that could 
be placed in it. But that's not what he does in "Freakonomics". He just a) puts the factoid straight in 
front of the reader with no qualifications at all and b) backs it up with a calculation that is clearly
flat out wrong. He's simultaneously teaching the lay reader to make definitive statements without
acknowledging estimation problems, and to ignore correlations between explanatory variables. How on earth 
can this not be worsening the overall level of debate?

## Chinese perspective on Western elite
([overview](#overview))

I love how Puzhong Yao comes across in his essay [The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/), about his experiences at Goldman Sachs, Cambridge and Stanford. He’s so honest and straight-laced he reminds me of myself before I ‘got more sophisticated’ in order to ‘navigate the turbulent realities of daily workplace politics’ (well, minimally, so I don’t drown). Here are some quotes I especially liked.

Result over process:

```markdown
My job at Goldman was a mixture of making markets to facilitate client trades and finding trades
for the bank’s own book. In early 2009, I believed it was an excellent trade to go long UK 
inflation. In fact, I thought it was such a good trade that my biggest worry was that there 
wouldn’t be anyone who would want to be on the other side of it. Yet we managed to put this
trade on versus a British bank. In the following year, the trade worked wonders, with UK 
inflation steadily rising, making the bank tens of millions in profits.

I thought I was an amazing trader. But there was a slight problem: I wanted to do the trade 
because I thought the market was pricing UK interest rates to go up. And when interest rates go 
up, UK inflation would rise mechanically due to the way it is defined and calculated. But in that
year, the Bank of England didn’t raise interest rates at all. Rather, the increase in inflation 
was due to things like tax increases, exchange rate fluctuations, oil price moves, etc.—things I
didn’t anticipate at all. It was pure luck that I made money, and I made it for the wrong reason.

When I was an intern, in one of the training presentations, a senior banker told us to distinguish
between the process and the results. He said that we should focus on the process, which we can
control, rather than the result, which is subject to luck. And here at Goldman, he said, we don’t
punish people for losing money for the right reason. I have always loved asking questions, so I 
asked him, was anyone ever punished for making money for the wrong reason? After giving it some
thought, he said that he had not heard of any such thing. And he was right. In fact, no one seemed
to remember the reason I did the inflation trade at all. They only remembered that I did this trade
and that it worked well.

When I met with my manager for a performance review after this, I was expecting to be berated for
my poor judgment. Instead, I got promoted! I told my manager that it was a mistake, but he merely
said, “Puzhong, tell no one.” He too was promoted on the basis of managing my “brilliant” trade. 
In fact, my manager was so proud of my work he recommended me to Stanford’s prestigious Graduate 
School of Business (GSB), and I soon set off for America.

Mottos as an example of Robin Hanson's "X isn't about Y":

```markdown
One class was about strategy. It focused on how corporate mottos and logos could inspire employees.
Many of the students had worked for nonprofits or health care or tech companies, all of which had 
mottos about changing the world, saving lives, saving the planet, etc. The professor seemed to like
these mottos.

I told him that at Goldman our motto was “be long-term greedy.” The professor couldn’t understand
this motto or why it was inspiring. I explained to him that everyone else in the market was short-term 
greedy and, as a result, we took all their money. Since traders like money, this was inspiring.

He asked if perhaps there was another motto or logo that my other classmates might connect with. I
told him about the black swan I kept on my desk as a reminder that low probability events happen with
high frequency.

He didn’t like that motto either and decided to call on another student, who had worked at Pfizer. 
Their motto was “all people deserve to live healthy lives.” The professor thought this was much better.

I didn’t understand how it would motivate employees, but this was exactly why I had come to Stanford:
to learn the key lessons of interpersonal communication and leadership.

On the importance of showing that you feel strongly about something, else it shows you aren't taking it seriously:

```markdown
On the communication and leadership front, I came to the GSB knowing I was not good and hoped to 
get better. My favorite class was called “Interpersonal Dynamics” or, as students referred to it,
“Touchy Feely.” In “Touchy Feely,” students get very candid feedback on how their words and actions 
affect others in a small group that meets several hours per week for a whole quarter.

We talked about microaggressions and feelings and empathy and listening. Sometimes in class the 
professor would say things to me like “Puzhong, when Mary said that, I could see you were really 
feeling something,” or “Puzhong, I could see in your eyes that Peter’s story affected you.” And I 
would tell them I didn’t feel anything. I was quite confused.

One of the papers we studied mentioned that subjects are often not conscious of their own feelings 
when fully immersed in a situation. But body indicators such as heart rate would show whether the 
person is experiencing strong emotions. I thought that I generally didn’t have a lot of emotions and
decided that this might be a good way for me to discover my hidden emotions that the professor kept
asking about.

So I bought a heart rate monitor and checked my resting heart rate. Right around 78. And when the 
professor said to me in class “Puzhong, I can see that story brought up some emotions in you,” I
rolled up my sleeve and checked my heart rate. It was about 77. And so I said, “nope, no emotion.” 
The experiment seemed to confirm my prior belief: my heart rate hardly moved, even when I was
criticized, though it did jump when I became excited or laughed.

This didn’t land well on some of my classmates. They felt I was not treating these matters with the
seriousness that they deserved. The professor was very angry. My takeaway was that my interpersonal
skills were so bad that I could easily offend people unintentionally, so I concluded that after 
graduation I should do something that involved as little human interaction as possible.
