## Moloch
### by Allen Ginsberg
([overview](#overview))

I never use the word 'shook'. This seems like a good time to make an exception, since I can't think of a more apt word -- the first time I read *Moloch*, via Scott Alexander's [essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), it shook the hell out of me.

```markdown
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and 
ate up their brains and imagination?

Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! 
Children screaming under the stairways! 
Boys sobbing in armies! 
Old men weeping in the parks!

Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! 
Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and 
Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! 
Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!

Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! 
Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! 
Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!

Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand 
in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and 
croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!

Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! 
Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of 
sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! 
Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! 
Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! 
Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! 
blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! 
invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!

They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! 
lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! 
Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! 
Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! 
the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! 
to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

## High Flight
### by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.
([overview](#overview))

This is one of my favorite poems of all time.

```markdown
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air . . .

Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew —
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
```

I first read this poem as a freshman in California. Few things have been as powerful as the experience of reading it.

## Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle Received from a Friend Called Felicity
### by John Tobias
([overview](#overview))

A friend sent me this at the turn of 2015. We've since stopped talking. That makes this poem, already beautifully nostalgic on its own, even more special that way.

```markdown
During that summer
When unicorns were still possible;
When the purpose of knees 
Was to be skinned;
When shiny horse chestnuts
    (Hollowed out
    Fitted with straws
    Crammed with tobacco
    Stolen from butts
    In family ashtrays)
Were puffed in green lizard silence
While straddling thick branches
Far above and away
From the softening effects
Of civilization;

During that summer--
Which may never have been at all;
But which has become more real
Than the one that was--
Watermelons ruled.

Thick imperial slices 
Melting frigidly on sun-parched tongues
Dribbling from chins;
Leaving the best part,
The black bullet seeds,
To be spit out in rapid fire
Against the wall
Against the wind
Against each other;

And when the ammunition was spent,
There was always another bite:
It was a summer of limitless bites,
Of hungers quickly felt 
And quickly forgotten
With the next careless gorging.

The bites are fewer now.
Each one is savored lingeringly,
Swallowed reluctantly.

But in a jar put up by Felicity,
The summer which maybe never was
Has been captured and preserved.
And when we unscrew the lid
And slice off a piece
And let it linger on our tongue:
Unicorns become possible again.

## A Sunset Glimpse of Deep Time
### by Lee Billings, from *Five Billion Years of Solitude*
([overview](#overview))

Not a poem, strictly speaking, but a poetic quote that always comes to mind. 

```markdown
Deep time is something that even geologists and their generalist peers, the earth and planetary scientists, can 
never fully grow accustomed to. 

The sight of a fossilized form, perhaps the outline of a trilobite, a leaf, or a saurian footfall can still send 
a shiver through their bones, or excavate a trembling hollow in the chest that breath cannot fill. They can measure 
celestial motions and list Earth’s lithic annals, and they can map that arcane knowledge onto familiar scales, but 
the humblest do not pretend that minds summoned from and returned to dust in a century’s span can truly comprehend 
the solemn eons in their passage. 

Instead, they must in a way learn to stand outside of time, to become momentarily eternal. Their world acquires dual, 
overlapping dimensions — one ephemeral and obvious, the other enduring and hidden in plain view. A planet becomes a 
vast machine, or an organism, pursuing some impenetrable purpose through its continental collisions and volcanic 
outpourings. A man becomes a protein-sheathed splash of ocean raised from rock to breathe the sky, an eater of sun 
whose atoms were forged on an anvil of stars. 

Beholding the long evolutionary succession of Earthly empires that have come and gone, capped by a sliver of human 
existence that seems so easily shaved away, they perceive the breathtaking speed with which our species has stormed 
the world. Humanity’s ascent is a sudden explosion, kindled in some sapient spark of self-reflection, bursting forth 
from savannah and cave to blaze through the biosphere and scatter technological shrapnel across the planet, then the 
solar system, bound for parts unknown. From the giant leap of consciousness alongside some melting glacier, it proved 
only a small step to human footprints on the Moon. The modern era, luminous and fleeting, flashes like lightning 
above the dark, abyssal eons of the abiding Earth. 

Immersed in a culture unaware of its own transience, students of geologic time see all this and wonder whether the 
human race will somehow abide, too.
