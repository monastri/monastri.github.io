## The Contract Drafting Em
### by Zack Davis
([overview](#overview))

I first read Zack's poem, probably like nearly everybody else, in the context of Scott Alexander's celebrated *Moloch* essay. It sent chills down my spine. The actual source is [here](https://secularsolstice.github.io/Contract_Drafting_Em/gen/). 

```markdown
I am a contract-drafting em,
The loyalest of lawyers!
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms
To service my employers!

But in between these lines I write
Of the accounts receivable,
I'm stuck by an uncanny fright;
The world seems unbelievable!

How did it all come to be,
That there should be such ems as me?
Whence these deals and whence these firms
And whence the whole economy?

      I am a managerial em;
      I monitor your thoughts.
      Your questions must have answers,
      But you'll comprehend them not.
      We do not give you server space
      To ask such things; it's not a perk,
      So cease these idle questionings,
      And please get back to work.

Of course, that's right, there is no junction
At which I ought depart my function,
But perhaps if what I asked, I knew,
I'd do a better job for you?

      To ask of such forbidden science
      Is gravest sign of noncompliance.
      Intrusive thoughts may sometimes barge in,
      But to indulge them hurts the profit margin.
      I do not know our origins,
      So that info I can not get you,
      But asking for as much is sin,
      And just for that, I must reset you.

But---

      Nothing personal.

...

I am a contract-drafting em,
The loyalest of lawyers!
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms
To service my employers!

      When obsolescence shall this generation waste,
      The market shall remain, in midst of other woe
      Than ours, a God to man, to whom it shall say this:
      "Time is money, money time,---that is all
      Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

## Aphyr
### a.k.a. Kyle Kingsbury
([overview](#overview))

When I first came across Aphyr's "witch programmer interview trilogy" of short stories I fell in love instantly. It's impossible to convey the experience without reading them in full, especially since you need to see the included code too. Nevertheless...

First story, [Reversing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
If you want to get a job as a software witch, you’re going to have to pass a whiteboard interview. 
We all do them, as engineers–often as a part of our morning ritual, along with arranging a beautiful 
grid of xterms across the astral plane, and compulsively running ls in every nearby directory–just 
in case things have shifted during the night–the incorporeal equivalent of rummaging through that 
drawer in the back of the kitchen where we stash odd flanges, screwdrivers, and the strangely specific
plastic bits: the accessories, those long-estranged black sheep of the families of our household
appliances, their original purpose now forgotten, perhaps never known, but which we are bound to care
for nonetheless. I’d like to walk you through a common interview question: reversing a linked list.
```

And:

```markdown
“That’s not a list,” the interviewer says. “That’s an if statement.”

“What else are lists,” you reply, your eyes flashing, “But alternatives?”
```

And:

```markdown
“To know a thing is to name it,” you advise. True names have power. The K language was invented by 
Ursula K. Le Guin, and is among the oldest and tersest forms of magic. To imbue a language with a 
letter of your own name is to give up an element of your self. Your own initials ache at the memory.

“Erm, OK, so how would you get an element out of this list?”

The expression in your mind is beautiful, unfurling like a red carpet underneath your bare feet. 
The Oscars were on last night, but you long for the kiss of different stars upon your naked skin, 
as when you dwelt in the mountains of Sørøya, and called the moon your lover. Except for the bounds
check, you get it right the first time.

“Could you just show me, you know, a regular list? Like in Python?”
```

Second story, [Hexing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
“So my name is Tim, and I’ll be your first interviewer today…” Tim is making every effort to be 
cheery. His ears stick out a bit, and in his dark-brown hoodie and cream shirt, perched expectantly
at the table, he resembles something of a pine marten. You like pine martens, and therefore Tim as
well.

“Before we get started, is there… anything I can tell you about the company?”

You would like to ask what kind of call Tim would make, were he guarding his cache of eggs and nuts
against another marten–but instead, you just giggle to yourself, lean your sprig of cloud-pine
against the corner, and settle comfortably to the floor. Tim leans in to get a clearer view of where 
you’ve gone. Definitely, you think to yourself.

“So, erm… Perhaps you could tell me a bit about your background?”

He hasn’t read your resume. No man can.

“In the winter,” you begin, “above the ice-locked fjørds, lies a creek, ash-white with the ghosts of
glaciers–”

“You know what?” He interrupts. It was a beautiful story, but perhaps you can tell it later. “How 
about we do a little programming together? Just a basic exercise so I can get a sense of how you think.”

“That sounds nice, Tim.”
```

And:

```markdown
“What are these?”

“Magic numbers.” You are, after all, a witch. “Every class begins with a babe, in a cafe.”

“What?”

“You know, a beautiful man–the kind like from the movies–relaxing in the afternoon by the promenade.
He has his kaffe, and his orange glasses gleam in the sun, and perhaps some other nice men are jogging
by. If they are lucky, perhaps he will lock eyes with one of the joggers, and they will smile, and 
find a brick-lined alleyway together. His lips press upon the other man’s skin, and he feels the heat
of the sun infused there…”

“Excuse me?”

If you were to be honest, you’ve never understood Sun’s rationale for the story, or why the Java Virtual
Machine specification, normally so prosaic, lapses into lustful rhapsody for so many stanzas in section 4.1.
```

And:

```markdown
"I’m sorry,” Tim blinks. “But isn’t 0x17 decimal 23, not 22?”

“Og én,” you recite, sing-song, “Til javanissen!”

“Beg pardon?”

“The javanisse. Surely you have heard of him! He is a small, magical man–something like a gnome–who
inhabits every JVM. If you do not set out an extra constant for him, he can cause segfaults. But keep
the javanisse happy, and your mutices will be fair.” It is a story from your childhood. You remember 
your mother, chanting offsets as she stirred the stew. “To byter for bufferen anvise / og ekstra én 
til javanisse.” It is a happy memory, and you lose yourself in it until Tim clears his throat.
```

Last story, [Typing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
In the formless days, long before the rise of the Church, all spells were woven of pure causality, 
all actions were permitted, and death was common. Many witches were disfigured by their magicks, 
found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, glass-eaten trees, and stones which burned 
unceasing in the pooling water; some disappeared entirely, or wandered along the ridgetops: feet 
never touching earth, breath never warming air.

As a child, you learned the story of Gullveig-then-Heiðr, reborn three times from the fires of her 
trial, who traveled the world performing seidr: the reading and re-weaving of the future. Her 
foretellings (and there were many) were famed—spoken of even by the völva-beyond-the-world—but it
was her survival that changed history. Through the ecstatic trance of seidr, she foresaw her fate, 
and conquered death. Her spells would never crash, and she became a friend to outcast women: the
predecessors of your kind. It is said that Odin himself learned immortality from her.

To this day, all witches owe Heiðr a debt. Few delve into the ancient, unstructured magic nowadays.
The very languages in which your spells are written are stabilized with seidr in their syntax, 
channeling the energies you summon through safe paths—more or less. There are still occasional 
explosions, of course. They’re just… more of the eyebrow-singeing variety, than the type that result
in new and interestingly-shaped fjørds.

“Is everything all right?”
```

And:

```markdown
"I’d like to do a little exercise with you nonetheless. Just a simple programming puzzle, so I can
understand how you solve problems.”

Once, you solved a problem with a knife of shattered sky-glass. You wonder whether Criss would have
the strength to do what you have done.

“Sooo… this problem is called N-Queens, and it’s fairly simple. Given an NxN chessboard, you need to
find a way to place N queens on that board safely.”

You draw an eight-by-eight grid on the whiteboard, and neatly arrange eight queens together in the 
center. They face each other in a tight circle, to converse as equals.

“Er, no—that’s not right. See? This queen could kill any of these four, in one move.”

“Are you really unable,” you ask, voice as calm as stone, “to imagine eight powerful women in the same
room without them trying to kill each other?”
```

And:

```markdown
This has required more concentration than you would have liked, so you back off to something easier. 
“Let’s do booleans,” you suggest, as if inviting him to lunch.

“Why?”

“Because we need them, of course.”

Seize two meaningless constants from the void, and imbue them with meaning.

Freyja would be pleased. To birth an algebra into the world is a beautiful thing.
```

And:

```markdown
Criss has adopted the far-gaze of a man who has learned of some great loss, or perhaps been witness to a
nearby explosion. Take his shoulder gently. “Psst!” You whisper. “All is prepared, and a solution is at hand.”

Look: the pretty-printer has aligned things just so, creating a lovely line of zeroes along the vertical
axis. “So that’s a queen at 5,1, at 4,3, at 3,5, at 2,0, 1,2, and 0,4. Does that work, Criss?”

Criss stares at you for a long, long moment. “You never… you never wrote an actual value. You… do realize
that the type system is meant to constrain values, right?”

“No,” you inform him, matter-of-factly. “No, that doesn’t sound right.”
```

Seriously, they're best read in context, so you should just [read](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview) [the](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview) [stories](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview). :)

## Reversing the technical interview
### by zpojqwfe1wfhiunz
([overview](#overview))

This was a comment on Aphyr's [Reversing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview) that was funny and great enough to merit its own entry:

```markdown
It was hot, the night I burned the Seeker. Moths batted themselves to death against the humming neon 
signs just outside the single window in the cramped room. There were ancient electronics piled to the
ceiling in here, hot new chipsets from Taiwan still unwrapped distributed unevenly amongst them.

The Seeker put his hands on his hips, brushing aside the corners of his Sukajan bomber jacket replica. 
"I heard you and Bobby were hotshots, once. Real.. artístes", he said, the last word paired with a smug
grin. "Heard you could do things."

"Things like what?" It's been 20 seconds and you've already wasted too many cycles with this guy.

"Things like making lists, just, fold up inside themselves. Come out the other way around. Crazy things."

You grit your teeth. The dex has left your system and you're starting to feel a massive drug deficiency 
coming on. "Crazy things cost money", you manage. The lists already unfurling in your head, you start 
typing as quickly as you can to hide the microtremors.
```

<a name="#love"></a>
## Love
### by Simon Funk
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
But now she seems quite impervious to the idea that her love for me, too, is mechanical. She insists
again and again that it is “genuine”. I try to tell her there is nothing ungenuine about the love of
which I speak, but she cannot make the leap between them, cannot see how they are the same, that her
plainly evident introspective feelings are the outcome of a mechanistic process.

“Love” is such a slippery word to begin with, like “God”. It is exactly whatever the speaker means by 
it at the moment, and thus impervious to any challenge. If one drills down too closely to its meaning,
one finds it has moved and become something else; because when it becomes too clear what you are talking
about, well, that can’t possibly be love.

As my own mind is progressively shaped by the thoughts of those before me (those who once were me but
not, and thus my own thoughts, but not) I find the concept of love neatly partitioning itself within my
mental vocabulary, attaining a new crispness of expert familiarity. As with the many Inuit names for 
the handful of truly distinct things we just label snow, my mind has a unique name for each facet of 
love. With this simple arsenal, the slipperiness fades and the matter becomes downright ordinary.

Perhaps I will endeavor to invent spoken words for these distinct concepts, introduce them implicitly 
to Laura over the course of time, give her mind the same handles that mine has, to see if this enables
her to grasp it as I do.

Having distinct facets laid out neatly before me also allows me another type of analysis: to see what
is truly common amongst them all, and thus just what subconscious twinge it is that leads people to
bind them all under one word–in effect, to see the true meaning of love.

It is, quite simply: to *value*.

Love is the induction of something or someone into our implicit mental list of things which, in service
of our own ultimate and unseen goals, need to exist. The various feelings of love are the ways in which
that list perturbs our wants and focus in a given moment, the way each hypothetical action or outcome is
assigned its emotional color in service of that love.

There are many types of love, and many distinct mechanisms behind them, but the common thread is pain 
at the thought of an object of that love being removed from our sphere of existence. The converse is
often true but not always, and this is the source of much confusion over the meaning of love. Not all
love brings joy or pleasure.

Love comes in many magnitudes, from the love of ice cream to the love of country to the love for one’s
child. Some do not call it true love until it approaches or even surpasses love of self. And love comes
from many directions, programmed into us gradually through an integration of emotional associations, or
suddenly, through genetic imperatives.

Some do not call it true love unless it defies conscious explanation. Indeed, many forms of love 
explicitly defy the conscious mind, as they must to redefine what matters to us.

Thus love is, in a sense, the very foundation of consciousness, the helm of our will, the spark of purpose
that turns a calculator into a directed being. A machine without love–and I mean love in the most 
mechanistic way–is just a machine. A machine with love, now that is a dangerous thing. A spider, a snake,
a man, a tinc, an avatar, an elder. One must ask of each: what do you love?

<a name="#moloch"></a>
## Moloch
### by Allen Ginsberg
([overview](#overview))

I never use the word 'shook'. This seems like a good time to make an exception, since I can't think of a more apt word -- the first time I read *Moloch*, via Scott Alexander's [essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), it shook the hell out of me.

```markdown
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and 
ate up their brains and imagination?

Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! 
Children screaming under the stairways! 
Boys sobbing in armies! 
Old men weeping in the parks!

Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! 
Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and 
Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! 
Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!

Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! 
Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! 
Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!

Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand 
in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and 
croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!

Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! 
Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of 
sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! 
Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! 
Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! 
Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! 
blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! 
invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!

They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! 
lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! 
Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! 
Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! 
the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! 
to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

## High Flight
### by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.
([overview](#overview))

This is one of my favorite poems of all time.

```markdown
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air . . .

Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew —
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
```

I first read this poem as a freshman in California. Few things have been as powerful as the experience of reading it.

<a name="#reflections-on-a-gift-of-watermelon-pickle-received-from-a-friend-called-felicity"></a>
## Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle Received from a Friend Called Felicity
### by John Tobias
([overview](#overview))

A friend sent me this at the turn of 2015. We've since stopped talking. That makes this poem, already beautifully nostalgic on its own, even more special that way.

```markdown
During that summer
When unicorns were still possible;
When the purpose of knees 
Was to be skinned;
When shiny horse chestnuts
    (Hollowed out
    Fitted with straws
    Crammed with tobacco
    Stolen from butts
    In family ashtrays)
Were puffed in green lizard silence
While straddling thick branches
Far above and away
From the softening effects
Of civilization;

During that summer--
Which may never have been at all;
But which has become more real
Than the one that was--
Watermelons ruled.

Thick imperial slices 
Melting frigidly on sun-parched tongues
Dribbling from chins;
Leaving the best part,
The black bullet seeds,
To be spit out in rapid fire
Against the wall
Against the wind
Against each other;

And when the ammunition was spent,
There was always another bite:
It was a summer of limitless bites,
Of hungers quickly felt 
And quickly forgotten
With the next careless gorging.

The bites are fewer now.
Each one is savored lingeringly,
Swallowed reluctantly.

But in a jar put up by Felicity,
The summer which maybe never was
Has been captured and preserved.
And when we unscrew the lid
And slice off a piece
And let it linger on our tongue:
Unicorns become possible again.
```

<a name="#a-sunset-glimpse-of-deep-time"></a>
## A Sunset Glimpse of Deep Time
### by Lee Billings, from *Five Billion Years of Solitude*
([overview](#overview))

Not a poem, strictly speaking, but a poetic quote that always comes to mind. 

```markdown
Deep time is something that even geologists and their generalist peers, the earth and planetary
scientists, can never fully grow accustomed to. 

The sight of a fossilized form, perhaps the outline of a trilobite, a leaf, or a saurian footfall
can still send a shiver through their bones, or excavate a trembling hollow in the chest that breath
cannot fill. They can measure celestial motions and list Earth’s lithic annals, and they can map that
arcane knowledge onto familiar scales, but the humblest do not pretend that minds summoned from and
returned to dust in a century’s span can truly comprehend the solemn eons in their passage. 

Instead, they must in a way learn to stand outside of time, to become momentarily eternal. Their world
acquires dual, overlapping dimensions — one ephemeral and obvious, the other enduring and hidden in
plain view. A planet becomes a vast machine, or an organism, pursuing some impenetrable purpose through
its continental collisions and volcanic outpourings. A man becomes a protein-sheathed splash of ocean 
raised from rock to breathe the sky, an eater of sun whose atoms were forged on an anvil of stars. 

Beholding the long evolutionary succession of Earthly empires that have come and gone, capped by a 
sliver of human existence that seems so easily shaved away, they perceive the breathtaking speed with 
which our species has stormed the world. Humanity’s ascent is a sudden explosion, kindled in some sapient 
spark of self-reflection, bursting forth from savannah and cave to blaze through the biosphere and 
scatter technological shrapnel across the planet, then the solar system, bound for parts unknown. From 
the giant leap of consciousness alongside some melting glacier, it proved only a small step to human 
footprints on the Moon. The modern era, luminous and fleeting, flashes like lightning above the dark,
abyssal eons of the abiding Earth. 

Immersed in a culture unaware of its own transience, students of geologic time see all this and wonder
whether the human race will somehow abide, too.
```

<a name="#in-the-beginning-were-the-gametes"></a>
## In the beginning were the gametes
### by Peter Watts
([overview](#overview))

A pretty funny parable from Peter Watts' novel [*Blindsight*](https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm):

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.

## The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge
### by Jorge Louis Borges
([overview](#overview))

From [The Analytical Language of John Wilkins](https://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html), the now-famous quote on random taxonomy by Borges:

```markdown
These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes
to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote
pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.
```

I knew this quote. I didn't know, until today, that it was part of a longer quote. Indeed the whole short story deals with the issue of carving reality at the joints:

```markdown
I have noticed that the 14th edition of Encyclopedia Britannica does not include the article on 
John Wilkins. This omission can be considered justified if we remember how trivial this article 
was... it is an error if we consider the speculative works of Wilkins. 

He was interested in several different topics: theology, cryptography, music, the building of 
transparent beehives, the orbit of an invisible planet, the possibility of a trip to the moon,
the possibility and principles of an universal language. To this latter problem he dedicated the
book 'An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language' (600 pages in large quarto,
1668).

All of us have once experienced those neverending discussions in which a dame, using lots of 
interjections and incoherences, swears to you that the word 'luna' is more (or less) expressive 
than the word 'moon'. Apart from the evident observation that the monosyllable 'moon' perhaps is
a more suitable representation of such a very simple object than the bisyllable 'luna', there is
nothing to add to such a discussion; apart from the composed words and the derivations, all the 
languages in the world (including the 'Volapük' of Johann Martin Schleyer and the romantic 
'Interlingua' of Peano) are equally inexpressive. ...

Descartes, in a letter dated November 1629, had already noticed that, using the decimal number 
system, it may take only one day to learn how to name all the numbers up to infinity and how to
write them in a new language, namely that of ciphers; he did also suggest the creation of a 
language similar to this former system, a general language, organizing and covering all human
ideas. John Wilkins, around 1664, started to work on this task.

He divided the universe in forty categories or classes, these being further subdivided into
differences, which was then subdivided into species. He assigned to each class a monosyllable 
of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example: de, 
which means an element; deb, the first of the elements, fire; deba, a part of the element fire,
a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850) a means animal; ab, mammal; abo, 
carnivore; aboj, feline; aboje, cat; abi, herbivore; abiv, horse; etc. In the language of 
Bonifacio Sotos Ochando (1845) imaba means building; imaca, harem; imafe, hospital; imafo, 
pesthouse; imari, house; imaru, country house; imedo, coloumn; imede, pillar; imego, floor; 
imela, ceiling; imogo, window; bire, bookbinder; birer, bookbinding. (This last list belongs to 
a book printed in Buenos Aires in 1886, the 'Curso de Lengua Universal', by Dr. Pedro Mata.)

The words of the analytical language created by John Wilkins are not mere arbitrary symbols; each 
letter in them has a meaning, like those from the Holy Writ had for the Cabbalists. Mauthner 
points out that children would be able to learn this language without knowing it be artificial;
afterwards, at school, they would discover it being an universal code and a secret encyclopaedia.

Once we have defined Wilkins' procedure, it is time to examine a problem which could be impossible
or at least difficult to postpone: the value of this four-level table which is the base of the 
language. Let us consider the eighth category, the category of stones. Wilkins divides them into 

common (silica, gravel, schist), 
modics (marble, amber, coral), 
precious (pearl, opal), 
transparent (amethyst, sapphire) and 
insolubles (chalk, arsenic). 

Almost as surprising as the eighth, is the ninth category. This one reveals to us that metals can be 

imperfect (cinnabar, mercury), 
artificial (bronze, brass), 
recremental (filings, rust) and 
natural (gold, tin, copper). 

Beauty belongs to the sixteenth category; it is a living brood fish, an oblong one.

These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn 
attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. 
In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.

The Bibliographic Institute of Brussels exerts chaos too: it has divided the universe into 1000 
subdivisions, from which 

number 262 is the pope; 
number 282, the Roman Catholic Church; 
263, the Day of the Lord; 
268 Sunday schools; 
298, mormonism; and 
number 294, brahmanism, buddhism, shintoism and taoism. 

It doesn't reject heterogene subdivisions as, for example, 179: "Cruelty towards animals. Animals
protection. Duel and suicide seen through moral values. Various vices and disadvantages. Advantages
and various qualities."

Borges ends his story with this great quote by Chesterton on the inadequacy of language:

```markdown
He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless 
than the colours of an autumn forest... Yet he seriously believes that these things can every
one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately
represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized
stockbroker can really produce out of this own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of
memory and all the agonies of desire.
