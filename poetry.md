## Elsewhere
### by Benjamin Rosenbaum
([overview](#overview))

[Elsewhere](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/elsewhere/) was just curiously *different* from anything else I've read. For one thing, the similes are as original as they come, and richly sensory. It's less than a thousand words, so you should just read the whole thing. 

One:

```markdown
There's an angle, a_q, which is like breakfast in a muddy room, like the weight of the morning:
pale-gold as butter and heavy as doubt.

It lies between the angle a_p (sharp and rueful as sand under your bottom lip) and the angle a_r
(stern and scouring as winds of incandescent plasma slashing through your fringe, as you make 
your way through the cloud-vaults of some middle heliosphere).

Let's call our protagonist Not Very—though a more accurate translation of en's actual name would
be any linear function mapping the set of all sets containing algorithmically computable 
functions onto the set of all sets containing no such functions.
```

Two:

```markdown
Not Very wandered among static images of Unlike Themselves' history, until en found the images
in which Unlike Themselves was wandering among images of Not Very's now. That's how they beat 
the time-skew problem: Not Very would express sentiments and opinions aloud, then shuffle through
the images to find those which contained (and had always already contained) Unlike Themselves' 
responses.

Ontology still divided them. This "counting"—apparently a kind of measuring related to sets and 
entities—seemed terribly important to Unlike Themselves. Not Very's world, in turn, was richer 
in modality: Not Very had Coulds, and Woulds, and even Shoulds; en could be mournful or giddy 
over hypotheticals. For Unlike Themselves, there was only Is.
```

Three:

```markdown
"Yes," said Unlike Themselves. "But here is something for you. You have infinity, yes?"

Not Very nodded, suppressing a twinge of jealousy. Not Very's universe was physically finite, 
so en had only mathematical infinity—it was one of the Coulds. It was as close as Not Very came
to counting: none, Self, Other, some, infinity. But Unlike Themselves' universe had real infinity:
its freedom, its terrifying oceanic release.

There was no definite measure of size where Not Very was; no finite "biggers" and "smallers." 
Certainly Not Very's world had no endpoint; certainly it was contiguous; certainly Not Very had 
never fallen into some pothole of unbeing where world was lacking. Finity made little everyday 
difference for Not Very. But still: Not Very's time and space were bounded, their countlessness 
a symptom of poverty, not abundance.
```

More similes:

```markdown
Compared to the infinite, the finite is precisely nothing: were the first universe subtracted from
the second, it would leave it utterly intact. Not Very felt an echo of that incessant outward 
pressure within enself, a longing acute and ghostly as neutrinos slicing through a moon.

...

a_s was approaching, an angle drowsy and thick as a pattering rain of hydrogen nuclei falling onto
the outer surface of a red and dying galaxy.

## The House Beyond Your Sky
### by Benjamin Rosenbaum
([overview](#overview))

[The House Beyond Your Sky](http://www.strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-house-beyond-your-sky/) is one of those stories that hooked me on the first line. The whole piece has a singsong quality to it that makes you want to recite it (more precisely, want Morgan Freeman to recite it) out loud. You should read the whole story; it's not much longer than the sum of the quotes below.

The introduction:

```markdown
Matthias browses through his library of worlds.

In one of them, a little girl named Sophie is shivering on her bed, her arms wrapped around
a teddy bear. It is night. She is six years old. She is crying, as quietly as she can.

The sound of breaking glass comes from the kitchen. Through her window, on the wall of the 
house next door, she can see the shadows cast by her parents. There is a blow, and one shadow 
falls; she buries her nose in the teddy bear and inhales its soft smell, and prays.

Matthias knows he should not meddle. But today his heart is troubled. Today, in the world 
outside the library, a pilgrim is heralded. A pilgrim is coming to visit Matthias, the first
in a very long time.

The pilgrim comes from very far away.

The pilgrim is one of us.

"Please, God," Sophie says, "please help us. Amen."

"Little one," Matthias tells her through the mouth of the teddy bear, "be not afraid."

Sophie sucks in a sharp breath. "Are you God?" she whispers.

"No, child," says Matthias, the maker of her universe.

"Am I going to die?" she asks.

"I do not know," Matthias says.

When they die—these still imprisoned ones—they die forever. She has bright eyes, a button 
nose, unruly hair. Sodium and potassium dance in her muscles as she moves. Unwillingly, 
Matthias imagines Sophie's corpse as one of trillions, piled on the altar of his own vanity
and self-indulgence, and he shivers.

"I love you, teddy bear," the girl says, holding him.

From the kitchen, breaking glass, and sobbing.
```

Another:

```markdown
We imagine you—you, the ones we long for—as if you came from our own turbulent and fragile
youth: embodied, inefficient, mortal. Human, say. So picture our priest Matthias as human: 
an old neuter, bird-thin, clear-eyed and resolute, with silky white hair and lucent purple skin.

Compared to the vast palaces of being we inhabit, the house of the priest is tiny—think of 
a clay hut, perched on the side of a forbidding mountain. Yet even in so small a house,
there is room for a library of historical simulations—universes like Sophie's—each teeming
with intelligent life.

The simulations, while good, are not impenetrable even to their own inhabitants. Scientists
teaching baboons to sort blocks may notice that all other baboons become instantly better at
block-sorting, revealing a high-level caching mechanism. Or engineers building their own 
virtual worlds may find they cannot use certain tricks of optimization and compression—for 
Matthias has already used them. Only when the jig is up does Matthias reveal himself, asking
each simulated soul: what now? Most accept Matthias's offer to graduate beyond the confines 
of their simulation, and join the general society of Matthias's house.

You may regard them as bright parakeets, living in wicker cages with open doors. The cages 
are hung from the ceiling of the priest's clay hut. The parakeets flutter about the ceiling,
visit each other, steal bread from the table, and comment on Matthias's doings.
```

And another:

```markdown
And we?

We who were born in the first ages, when space was bright—swimming in salt seas, or churned
from a mush of quarks in the belly of a neutron star, or woven in the labyrinthine folds of 
gravity between black holes. We who found each other, and built our intermediary forms, our 
common protocols of being. We who built palaces—megaparsecs of exuberantly wise matter, every
gram of it teeming with societies of self—in our glorious middle age!

Now our universe is old. That breath of the void, quintessence, which once was but a whisper 
nudging us apart, has grown into a monstrous gale. Space billows outward, faster than light 
can cross it. Each of our houses is alone, now, in an empty night.

And we grow colder to survive. Our thinking slows, whereby we may in theory spin our pulses 
of thought at infinite regress. Yet bandwidth withers; our society grows spare. We dwindle.

We watch Matthias, our priest, in his tiny house beyond our universe. Matthias, whom we built
long ago, when there were stars.
```

A prayer:

```markdown
Matthias prays.

O God who is as far beyond the universes I span as infinity is beyond six; O startling Joy
that hides beyond the tragedy and blindness of our finite forms; lend me Your humility and 
strength. Not for myself, O Lord, do I ask, but for Your people, the myriad mimetic engines
of Your folk; and in Your own Name. Amen.
```

The final battle -- the last line moved me:

```markdown
Matthias is no warrior. He cannot see the inhabitants of his house, of his library, butchered.
He will choose slavery over extermination.

Geoffrey, though, is another matter.

As Matthias is about to speak, the Graspers erupt into the general process space of the house.
They are a violent people. They have been imprisoned for an age, back in their virtual world.
But they have never forgotten the house. They are armed and ready.

And they have united with Geoffrey.

Geoffrey/Grasper is their general. He knows every nook and cranny of the house. He knows 
better, too, than to play at memes and infinite loops and logic bombs with the pilgrim, who
has had a billion years to refine his arsenal of general-purpose algorithmic weapons.

Instead, the Graspers instantiate physically. They capture the lowest-level infrastructure 
maintenance system of the house, and build bodies among the ontotropes, outside the body of 
the house, beyond the virtual machine—bodies composed of a weird physics the pilgrim has never
mastered. And then, with the ontotropic equivalent of diamond-bladed saws, they begin to cut
into the memory of the house.

Great blank spaces appear—as if the little hut on the mountain is a painting on thick paper,
and someone is tearing strips away.

The pilgrim responds—metastasizing, distributing himself through the process space of the
house, dodging the blades. But he is harried by Graspers and parakeets, spotters who find each
bit of him and pounce, hemming it in. They report locations to the Grasper-bodies outside. The
blades whirr, ontic hyperstates collapse and bloom, and pieces of pilgrim, parakeet, and 
Grasper are annihilated—primaries and backups, gone.

Shards of brute matter fall away from the house, like shreds of paper, like glittering snow,
and dissolve among the wild maze of the ontotropes, inimical to life.

Endpoints in time are established for a million souls. Their knotted timelines, from birth to
death, hang now in n-space: complete, forgiven.
```

The end:

```markdown
Behind Matthias's house, a universe is brewing.

Already, the whenlines between this new universe and our ancient one are fused: we now occur
irrevocably in what will be its past. Constants are being chosen, symmetries defined. Soon, a
nothing that was nowhere will become a place; a never that was nowhen will begin, with a flash
so mighty that its echo will fill a sky forever.

Thus—a point, a speck, a thimble, a room, a planet, a galaxy, a rush towards the endless.

There, after many eons, you will arise, in all your unknowable forms. Find each other. Love. 
Build. Be wary.

Your universe in its bright age will be a bright puddle, compared to the empty, black ocean 
where we recede from each other, slowed to the coldest infinitesimal pulses. Specks in a sea 
of night. You will never find us.

But if you are lucky, strong, and clever, someday one of you will make your way to the house 
that gave you birth, the house among the ontotropes, where Sophie waits.

Sophie, keeper of the house beyond your sky.

## Gravity drowned
### by TALE-SPIN (an AI)
([overview](#overview))

From Rob Bensinger's [Bridge Collapse: Reductionism as Engineering Problem](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jlg/bridge_collapse_reductionism_as_engineering/):

```markdown
Once upon a time — specifically, 1976 — there was an AI named TALE-SPIN. This AI told stories
by inferring how characters would respond to problems from background knowledge about the 
characters' traits. One day, TALE-SPIN constructed a most peculiar tale.

*Henry Ant was thirsty.

He walked over to the river bank where his good friend Bill Bird was sitting.

Henry slipped and fell in the river.

Gravity drowned.*

Since Henry fell in the river near his friend Bill, TALE-SPIN concluded that Bill rescued Henry.
But for Henry to fall in the river, gravity must have pulled Henry. Which means gravity must have
been in the river. TALE-SPIN had never been told that gravity knows how to swim; and TALE-SPIN
had never been told that gravity has any friends. So gravity drowned.

TALE-SPIN had previously been programmed to understand involuntary motion in the case of characters
being pulled or carried by other characters — like Bill rescuing Henry. So it was programmed to 
understand 'character X fell to place Y' as 'gravity moves X to Y', as though gravity were a
character in the story.

## Interlude מ: Miss American Pie
### by Jesse Han
([overview](#overview))

I know Jesse Han’s [Infinity Breathes](https://wspucla.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/guest-blog-infinity-breathes-by-jesse-han/) is a good story, because it’s been months and years since I last read it and I can still distinctly recall phrases original (as far as I can determine) to the story—*lightning through sand*, for instance; *only great invisible crashing*; *I wake up dreaming, at dusk, of a synaesthesia sunrise*. Only good stories do that.

Here are three quotes (out of many) that I liked.

I.
```markdown
Joan Didion writes that writers—archivists, keepers of private notebooks, of memory’s 
palace—are of a different breed altogether, anxious malcontents, lonely and resistant 
rearrangers of things who have learned, from an early age, a preternatural preoccupation
with loss. Writing is a sort of nervous tic, a stab at survival for those who continually 
run from that elemental private reflection: *This must end*.

The summer I was thirteen, back when I still felt like I could remember everything, could 
still draw for you, if asked, a clean narrative arc from my first conscious memory
(December sunlight streaming through the half-open window of my parents’ bedroom) to the 
there and then—I spent an idyllic August weekend alone in my room scrawling on 
college-ruled filler paper a twenty-page autobiographical manuscript.

At the end, before signing my name, I wrote “I’ll be gone soon, just a fading memory. But
I’m here *now*, and I exist, and I’m *alive*. Remember me. Everything I’ve told you. Remember
who I was, who you were. Who we are. All this; the music of our dreams. Now: go.”

Or something like that; I’ve half-forgotten.
```

II.
```markdown
Some things I still remember only because I have written. Memories: Here. Look. In one, 
I stand at the cliff along Ocean Avenue, overlooking the beach, at the end of one of my
nighttime walks. The sun had broken over the tops of the buildings and there was a band 
of clouds low over the horizon that caught the light just at that moment and was lit up 
a brilliant reddish-pink. But the clouds were at a low-enough angle to the water so that
the whole ocean turned into a mirror, captured and threw back all that light—and so for 
a short time the world was this pastel layering of color—the brown-yellow of the sand; 
the entire ocean and the clouds above dawn-red, with a band of perfect blue sky in between.

In another, I prove for the first time that the subobject classifier for the the category
of presheaves over the rational numbers viewed as a poset category must be isomorphic in 
a natural way to the reals viewed as a dense linear ordering with endpoints. Two days it 
took me. Hours alone at my desk. I lost myself, along the way, down a dozen dead ends. 
So many abortive attempts. And yet, when I slid the last keystone into place, set down my
pen, felt in my mind the proof humming to life—I can still remember it now, because I *gave
so much* to write it—I could’ve sworn, marveling at the ultimate symmetry of the structure
I’d unearthed, had revealed on the pages around me, that I was watching the very same sunrise.

In another, someone I love touches me the way light falls through leaves.

…

I submit this: that if the purpose of literature is to make heads throb heartlike, then 
the purpose of writing, of mathematics (two manifestations of the same abstract activity),
is to make language throb lifelike. We write, not to survive, but to *live*. We sound truth
with language; we press ourselves into pages; we step back, and—looking at what is now
before us, at what until then we could only have dreamed of, at what now on the page lives
and breathes—we know that we are alive.
```

III.
```markdown
Consider this: I glance at a problem and the outlines of a solution flash through me—a shiver
down my spine, lightning through sand—and I spend the rest of the night lost in that crystal
forest, hunting for glints of lightning-glass. Because I know what comes after: I set down 
by pen, and at a flick of my mind the forest lights up and glassens, turns perfectly 
transparent, a shimmering lattice—and then, after a few seconds, the light vanishes, and the
forest shatters, comes down in total blackout, without one glint, only great invisible crashing.
And all that’s left is all I need; it’s *there*, the solution, my hard-won understanding, all of 
it, all the Antikytherean complexity of it, glowing from the pages on my desk. *I have dreamed 
of you. I have made you real*: infinity breathes.

## Interlude מ: Miss American Pie
### by Scott Alexander
([overview](#overview))

There is this thing that crackpots and conspiracy theorists do — which, for want of a more fitting descriptive, I’ll call “alternative interpretation”; you may pattern-match it to “seeing faces in the clouds” if you want — that Scott Alexander is really, *really* good at. Here's [an example](http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%9E-miss-american-pie/) from his serial novel [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/):

```markdown
Today we were arguing about the lyrics of American Pie. She thought it was about rock n’ roll.
I thought it was about Christian soteriology’s claim to supersede the Jewish conception of divine law.

The first stanza was clearly setting up a contrast between the twin poles of song and dance. Song
represented divine goodness or mercy. Its first three letters were “son”, corresponding to the 
second person of the Christian Trinity, and there were the kabbalistic implications from UNSONG
and Peter Singer to consider. Dance represented divine justice, because its first three letters
were “dan”, and “dan” or “din” is Hebrew for “judgment”, like in the Beth Din or the name Daniel,
“judgment of God”.

That wasn’t how I earned the onion, though. I’d earned the onion because of the chorus. He drove
a Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry. Well, “shevet” was the Hebrew word for “tribe”, so 
a Chevy at the levee means the Tribe of Levi, ie the priesthood. John 7:24 says that “Whoever 
believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’”
When the song says that the levee/Levites were dry, it’s pushing the standard Christian line that
the Pharisee priests of Jesus’ day had become so obsessed with the Law that they had lost true faith.

Apparently Erica believed this interpretation merited an onion, even though in the very next line
they refer to whiskey, which comes from the Irish uisce beatha, meaning “water of life”, which is 
practically an exact match for the John quote. I had a tough audience.

Bill Dodd walked in through the unlocked door, saw the table empty but for myself. “Am I early?” 
he asked.

“Everyone else is late, as usual,” said Erica. “Please, save me. Aaron was just trying to convince
me that American Pie is about Christian soteriology.”

Then she had to explain the whole conversation thus far to Bill, and then Bill protested that it
was obviously about the history of rock and roll, even though it clearly wasn’t. “Seriously!” I 
protested. “The very next stanza starts out with ‘Did you write the Book of Love / Do you have 
faith in God above / if the Bible tells you so?’ How do you not see that as an attempt to contrast
the Old Testament – the Book of the Law – with the New Testament as the Book of Love, offering 
salvation by faith?”

“Book of Love is a famous rock n’ roll song,” said Bill, “and the very next line is ‘do you believe
in rock n’ roll.”

“Exactly!” I told him. “Salvation by faith requires belief in Christ’s resurrection. The most
obvious sign of which was that the rock blocking his tomb had been rolled away. Then ‘Can music 
save your mortal soul?’ Music = song = the Son, as I said before! It’s saying that Christ saves 
people’s souls! And then dancing real slow is the suspension of divine judgment!”

“I know that you’re in love with him, because I saw you dancing in the gym,” continued Erica. 
“Where in the New Testament does Christ dance in a gym?”

“Dancing means divine judgment!” I repeated. “And ‘gym’ is Greek for naked. There’s a perfectly 
clear part of the Bible that links nakedness to divine judgment, and that’s Genesis 3! The Garden
of Eden narrative! We know that God is in love with humanity because even despite the justice of 
punishing original sin, He chooses not to do so.”

“You both kicked off your shoes,” protested Bill.

“Exodus 3:5,” I said. “And the LORD said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy 
feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.”

Erica threw another onion slice at me. It missed by half an inch.

“Look,” said Bill. “You can fit individual pieces to relevant Bible verses. I’ll even give you 
that you mostly stuck to the Jesus theme. But the song as a whole only makes sense in the context
of rock n’ roll. For example, just after the shoes part, it mentions a pink carnation, which was
what young men traditionally wore to dance halls.”

“And which also contains ‘incarnation’ as a substring. You don’t think that an Incarnation could 
possibly have anything to do with…”

The door opened. Zoe Farr came in. “Hey guys. What are you yelling about? I could hear you all the
way out in the driveway.”

“AARON IS TRYING TO SAY THAT AMERICAN PIE IS ABOUT JESUS,” yelled Erica. “HE IS SAYING THAT THE 
CHEVY AT THE LEVY IS THE TRIBE OF LEVITES AND THE PINK CARNATION IS THE INCARNATION. YOU NEED TO
MAKE HIM STOP.”

“Calm down,” said Zoe. “That sounds kind of fun. Even though I think I read somewhere that American
Pie is about the history of rock n’ roll. It even mentions the Rolling Stones at one point.”

“Okay,” I said. “Fine. You want to talk Rolling Stones? Let’s talk Rolling Stones. The relevant 
stanza begins ‘for ten years we’ve been on our own.’ In Bible prophecy, a day of God represents a
year – this is why the seventy weeks of Daniel correspond to the 490 years after Daniel’s own time.
So ten years by that conversion equals 3650 years. The Seder Olam Rabbah dates the creation of the 
world as 3761 BC, so in Biblical time the birth of Christ is about ten years and three months from 
Creation. That’s not a coincidence because nothing is ever a – ”

“And the Rolling Stones?” asked Bill.

“For the love of God, I already told you,” I said. “Resurrection of Christ. Matthew 28:2. ‘And, 
behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came 
and rolled back the stone from the door.'”

“Wait…” said Zoe.

“No, you wait,” I said. “Let’s go over exactly what happens in the rest of that verse. The King is
looking down – obvious reference to God entering the world, especially paired with the incarnation
part earlier. Jester has clear phonetic resemblance to “Jesus”, sounds even better if you use the 
original “Yeshua”. He’s wearing a coat borrowed from James Dean. But we know the root ‘dan’ or ‘din’
means ‘justice’ in Hebrew. So ‘James Dean’ deciphers to ‘James the Just’, who is described in Acts 
as ‘the brother of Jesus’. Most commentators reconcile this with Jesus’ supposed heavenly descent by
saying he was a half-brother from Mary. So James the Just represents Jesus’ human bloodline, which 
means the ‘coat borrowed from James Dean’ is the human form that He incarnates into, like a coat. 
So we have God coming down into the world and taking human form, and even having a human soul – a
“voice that came from you and me”. Then he ‘steals a thorny crown’ – I hope I don’t have to explain
that one to you. What happens then? ‘The courtroom is adjourned; no verdict is returned.’ The Law 
is supplanted; divine punishment is suspended. This would all be super obvious if you would just 
stop with your stupid rock n’ roll obsession.”

“The very next verse mentions John Lennon!” Erica protested.

“Lennon! Lennon is a Avgad cipher for Moses! Lamed – nun – nun, move all the letters one forward,
mem – samech – samech spells ‘Moses’. And Marx. This was all in that article you rejected for the
Standard. Marx means ‘man of war’, so it’s a reference to God. Moses is reading a book on God – 
the Torah. The whole thing is happening “while Lennon read a book on Marx”, ie along with it. Jesus 
comes not to supplant the law but to fulfill it. And then! A quartet is practicing in the park – 
that’s the Four Evangelists. Dirges in the dark the day the music died. The music is the song is
Jesus. The day the music died is the day Jesus died. Mark 15:33, ‘And when the sixth hour was come,
there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.’ They’re singing dirges in the dark 
because Jesus just died and a supernatural darkness descended over the land.”

“What descended over the land?” asked Ally Hu. She had just come in. I had been so intent in
correcting my friends’ misperceptions about American Pie that I hadn’t even noticed her.

“Supernatural darkness,” I said. “I’m explaining American Pie to these guys. We were at the part 
about singing dirges in the dark. It’s a reference to the supernatural darkness that covered the 
land after Jesus’ crucifixion.”

“I do not know so much about American culture,” said Ally, “but I thought that this song was about 
a history of rock n’ roll.”

“THAT’S WHAT WE’VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL HIM,” said Erica, at the same time I muttered “Et tu, Ally?”

“Exactly,” said Bill. “For example, the next verse references Helter-Skelter, Eight Miles High, and
The Birds. Helter-Skelter is a Beatles song, the Byrds are a rock band, and Eight Miles High is a 
song by the Byrds.”

“The verse goes,” I said, “Helter-skelter, in the summer swelter, the birds flew off with a fallout
shelter eight miles high and falling fast. Is there a rock band called ‘Fallout Shelter’? Is there 
a Grammy-award winning song by that name?”

“Not everything has to…”

“Everything has to!” I said. “Nothing is ever a coincidence. Look. The Bible contains a clear example
of a fallout shelter related to divine judgment. Noah’s Ark. God decided to destroy the world for its
wickedness, and Noah built something to survive the apocalypse. That’s a fallout shelter. It’s even 
eight miles high. The floodwaters covered the earth to a depth higher than the highest mountain. 
Everest is six miles high, the floodwaters had to be above that, leave a little margin of error, 
that’s eight miles. And falling fast, because after forty days and nights God opened the portals of
the deep and the waters flowed back in. According to the story, Noah sent forth a raven and a dove 
to see if they could find dry land. In other words, the birds flew off, with the fallout shelter eight 
miles high and falling fast. The raven can’t find any dry land. But the dove can. It lands, fowl on 
the grass. The jester is Jesus is the Son is the Song is divine mercy, but it’s on the sidelines in 
a cast because at this point divine mercy has been suspended – even wounded – and divine judgment 
allowed to have free rein.”

“Oh wow,” said Zoe.

“You skipped the part about the players trying for a forward pass,” said Bill.

“The players are all the people and animals, trying to pass their genes forward to the next
generation. The marching band which is trying to interfere – well, think about it. There are 
two interesting facets of a marching band. They play music. And they march. Who does that sound
like? Right. The angels. The heavenly choirs and the heavenly hosts. So the players – created 
mortal beings – are trying to take the field. But the angels and nephilim refuse to yield – 
they’ve seized control of the earth. So ‘do you recall what was revealed’? How do you say
‘revealed’ in Greek? Right. ‘Apokalypsis’. The angels tried to control the earth and wouldn’t 
make room for humans, so God called down an apocalypse. That’s why this is in the verse that 
talks about Noah’s Ark.”

The doorbell rang. It was Eli Foss. “Hey,” he said. “Is dinner…”

“Okay,” I said. “Just so we don’t have to go over this yet again, and I don’t have to answer 
every one of your dumb complaints in order. The generation lost in space was the generation 
of the Exodus who were lost in the desert for forty years. The time we were all in one place
was Sinai, where according to the rabbis all the souls of Jews past present and future were 
present for the revelation of the Ten Commandments. Jack is Jacob is Israel is the Israelites.
The candlestick is the pillar of fire by night. The Devil is the Devil. A plain that climbs 
high into the night is a hill or mountain; it’s arguing that the theophany at Sinai naturally
concluded on Golgotha. The sacrificial rite was the crucifixion. Satan is laughing with delight 
because Jesus just died. The girl who sang the blues is Mary Magdalene, who is sitting outside
the tomb crying. They ask her for happy news because she’s the first to witness the Resurrection.
She smiles and turns away as per Mark 16: “neither said they any thing to any man; for they were
afraid.” The sacred store where they had heard the music years before is the Temple, but the 
music wouldn’t play because the system of Temple sacrifices has been replaced by a direct 
relationship with God. In the streets the children are screaming and so on because Jesus is dead.
The church bells are broken because Jesus is dead; kind of a heavy-handed metaphor, but whatever.
The three men I admire most represent the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, exactly like he says. 
Do any of you have any other questions?”

## Polynomials and power series

Grothendieck’s approach to algebraic geometry was not universally loved, especially among analysts: some felt that the thousands of pages of abstraction was just “language” that obscured, rather than revealed. 

In this context, here’s Shreeram S. Abhyankar’s poem [Polynomials and Power Series](https://books.google.co.jp/books?dq=abhyankar+eliminate&hl=en&id=0-lbEHZncbIC&lpg=PA783&ots=2oyN6dKXHg&pg=PA783&redir_esc=y&sa=X&sig=Xdc6R0RLknoy_7vfgNOGeP5X8sY&source=bl#v=onepage&q=abhyankar%20eliminate&f=false), written at the 1970 ICM in Nice, inspired by van der Waerden’s historical lecture on the development of algebraic geometry.

## Near a raven
([overview](#overview))

740-word composition in [Standard Pilish](http://www.cadaeic.net/pilish.htm), i.e. the number of letters in each successive word "spells out" the digits of π, retelling Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven". Original [here](http://www.cadaeic.net/naraven.htm).

```markdown 
   Poe, E. 
      Near a Raven

Midnights so dreary, tired and weary. 
    Silently pondering volumes extolling all by-now obsolete lore. 
During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap! 
    An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber's antedoor. 
        "This", I whispered quietly, "I ignore".

Perfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering ember. 
    Inflamed by lightning's outbursts, windows cast penumbras upon this floor. 
Sorrowful, as one mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded: 
    That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore - 
        Is delighting, exciting...nevermore.

Ominously, curtains parted (my serenity outsmarted), 
    And fear overcame my being - the fear of "forevermore". 
Fearful foreboding abided, selfish sentiment confided, 
    As I said, "Methinks mysterious traveler knocks afore. 
        A man is visiting, of age threescore."

Taking little time, briskly addressing something: "Sir," (robustly) 
    "Tell what source originates clamorous noise afore? 
Disturbing sleep unkindly, is it you a-tapping, so slyly? 
    Why, devil incarnate!--" Here completely unveiled I my antedoor-- 
        Just darkness, I ascertained - nothing more.

While surrounded by darkness then, I persevered to clearly comprehend. 
    I perceived the weirdest dream...of everlasting "nevermores". 
Quite, quite, quick nocturnal doubts fled - such relief! - as my intellect said, 
    (Desiring, imagining still) that perchance the apparition was uttering a whispered "Lenore". 
        This only, as evermore.

Silently, I reinforced, remaining anxious, quite scared, afraid, 
    While intrusive tap did then come thrice - O, so stronger than sounded afore. 
"Surely" (said silently) "it was the banging, clanging window lattice." 
    Glancing out, I quaked, upset by horrors hereinbefore, 
        Perceiving: a "nevermore".

Completely disturbed, I said, "Utter, please, what prevails ahead. 
    Repose, relief, cessation, or but more dreary 'nevermores'?" 
The bird intruded thence - O, irritation ever since! - 
    Then sat on Pallas' pallid bust, watching me (I sat not, therefore), 
        And stated "nevermores".

Bemused by raven's dissonance, my soul exclaimed, "I seek intelligence; 
    Explain thy purpose, or soon cease intoning forlorn 'nevermores'!" 
"Nevermores", winged corvus proclaimed - thusly was a raven named? 
    Actually maintain a surname, upon Pluvious seashore? 
        I heard an oppressive "nevermore".

My sentiments extremely pained, to perceive an utterance so plain, 
    Most interested, mystified, a meaning I hoped for. 
"Surely," said the raven's watcher, "separate discourse is wiser. 
    Therefore, liberation I'll obtain, retreating heretofore - 
        Eliminating all the 'nevermores' ".

Still, the detestable raven just remained, unmoving, on sculptured bust. 
    Always saying "never" (by a red chamber's door). 
A poor, tender heartache maven - a sorrowful bird - a raven! 
    O, I wished thoroughly, forthwith, that he'd fly heretofore. 
        Still sitting, he recited "nevermores".

The raven's dirge induced alarm - "nevermore" quite wearisome. 
    I meditated: "Might its utterances summarize of a calamity before?" 
O, a sadness was manifest - a sorrowful cry of unrest; 
    "O," I thought sincerely, "it's a melancholy great - furthermore, 
        Removing doubt, this explains 'nevermores' ".

Seizing just that moment to sit - closely, carefully, advancing beside it, 
    Sinking down, intrigued, where velvet cushion lay afore. 
A creature, midnight-black, watched there - it studied my soul, unawares. 
    Wherefore, explanations my insight entreated for. 
        Silently, I pondered the "nevermores".

"Disentangle, nefarious bird! Disengage - I am disturbed!" 
    Intently its eye burned, raising the cry within my core. 
"That delectable Lenore - whose velvet pillow this was, heretofore, 
    Departed thence, unsettling my consciousness therefore. 
        She's returning - that maiden - aye, nevermore."

Since, to me, that thought was madness, I renounced continuing sadness. 
    Continuing on, I soundly, adamantly forswore: 
"Wretch," (addressing blackbird only) "fly swiftly - emancipate me!" 
    "Respite, respite, detestable raven - and discharge me, I implore!" 
        A ghostly answer of: "nevermore".

" 'Tis a prophet? Wraith? Strange devil? Or the ultimate evil?" 
    "Answer, tempter-sent creature!", I inquired, like before. 
"Forlorn, though firmly undaunted, with 'nevermores' quite indoctrinated, 
    Is everything depressing, generating great sorrow evermore? 
        I am subdued!", I then swore.

In answer, the raven turned - relentless distress it spurned. 
    "Comfort, surcease, quiet, silence!" - pleaded I for. 
"Will my (abusive raven!) sorrows persist unabated? 
    Nevermore Lenore respondeth?", adamantly I encored. 
        The appeal was ignored.

"O, satanic inferno's denizen -- go!", I said boldly, standing then. 
    "Take henceforth loathsome "nevermores" - O, to an ugly Plutonian shore! 
Let nary one expression, O bird, remain still here, replacing mirth. 
    Promptly leave and retreat!", I resolutely swore. 
        Blackbird's riposte: "nevermore".

So he sitteth, observing always, perching ominously on these doorways. 
    Squatting on the stony bust so untroubled, O therefore. 
Suffering stark raven's conversings, so I am condemned, subserving, 
    To a nightmare cursed, containing miseries galore. 
        Thus henceforth, I'll rise (from a darkness, a grave) -- nevermore!

                        -- Original: E. Poe

## Pieces of centaurs
([overview](#overview))

Encodes in word length the first 768 digits of the number τ = 2π. This wasn't hard enough for Mike, so he upped the ante with two additional constraints: 

(1) Since 768 is divisible by 8, Mike had each of the 8 stanzas cover exactly 768/8 = 96 digits.
(2) To make the reference to the number 'tau' even stronger, each stanza uses a word which includes the trigram "tau"; e.g. res(tau)rant in the second stanza. The first stanza does not do this explicitly, instead hiding the "tau" in the phrase "horse/man", a synonym for cen(tau)r. Note that the title, "(Pi)eces of Cen(tau)rs", includes both "pi" and "tau".

```markdown
   Pieces of Centaurs

Before an overcast sky a graceful horse/man celebrates quietly.
A furnace radiating light combines colors with shadows,
Fitful fantasies in grays or crimsons:
Softly swaying animal bodies among trees,
Athenians collecting polyanthus, 
Women sitting around firepits.
Not impressed with her own thoughts, someone somewhere swallows seafoam.
Genii disappoint, as pigeonholed people find a nightmare
Amid evasively-answered answered questions.
A nobleman says: verily, I shall punish him 
In bleeding uncontrolled anger, 
Feeding it like a starved crocodile. 
Mountains incline to touch broken shorelines before breakfast.
Summer tries, collapsing vainly. Everyone sees it die. 

Only a few words wistfully remain:
Love. Me. Everybody. Please.
I capture the restaurant as silent chefs simply flee 
Across a sky of capillary hues.
A thousand puffins hurtle backward, returning to a farmhouse,
A deliberate destination within that blue valley,
The home every adventurer desires:
A southern exposure, a meadow of mossy tundra.
Predators circle in my own yard, preparing themselves.
Mosquitoes which people regarded as immaterial sting them, 
Despoiling the children. Outside, through glistening mist, 
We go heavenwards, desperately resisting it. 
Remember, everybody: he will allow anything.
Anything's allowed, anything's sufficient. 

Weariness produces little difference between acting and desisting, 
So listless delirium comes, abiding within me. 
A pointless white, a sad red, a pregnant purple:
Bitter rainbows extending in an oddly feeble facsimile,
Under instructions contained within some manual.
Autumn's lunar eclipse now grows weaker: 
Weaker, old and frightened about week-to-week corruption. 
For pleasure I tabulate my tautology.
Mathematical mechanics monitor a man who despises life.
Virtue withdraws, as everything stands shameless without it. 
So perfection vegetates...cautiously, silently. 
People quest for it elsewhere. 
People call it absurd. 
Another question remains: do I?

Look there: an escutcheon, four weathered harpoons, an inkstand.
An ebony sign: ELYSIUM PAWN SHOP. 
Staunchly a workman sits, resembling a god of underworldly status. 
The comfortable breezes soothe all that wishfully shuffle nearby.
The proprietor bows a careworn head. A whistling is heard beyond trees. 
Visitors enter, discreetly carrying a crucifix. 
One buys, one undersells, evading an intimate episode. 
The hoary workman silently opens a lifetime assessment, updates it,
Underlines feverishly in an ornate ledger. 
I understand. Surely, I understand: 
Universes, planets, fishes, life, everything. Important, yes? 
The shopkeeper nods "no", sobbing softly. 

Soldiers go northward and southward throughout the crippled kingdoms. 
The ideologues go out to a concrete building before supper.
Nincompoops tell tales with indefinite endings.
For a while I aggravate a suburban man 
Spiraling helplessly inside a selfmade hell. 
The timbers of an old shed crumble within his swelling breast, 
Parts of an old wound remotely buried in a churchyard
By the taurine statuettes.
Dismissed before a king, seasonal travelers go east
Hanging their Christmas ornaments on their ears. 
Democracy resembles a new play opening feverishly and quickly closing.
I throw discretion under that rock. 

Suffering mortals decrease in good faith 
While politics putters beside the filthy mirror,
Reflection of the inherent intrinsic weakness in large platforms.
Poetry cannot explain the song before sunrise, he says,
Although Saturday I saw a hen in Grandpa's meadow. 
A painter of bitterness inks my forearm.
Everyone overturns, everyone overburns, 
In anxious expectant landscapes. 
Wood bows oscillate taut strings with sad melodies.
I talk discreetly with the women, imagining picnics in a vineyard, 
Carrying flowers with flocculent stems. 
Annis eyes a straggling sunbeam floating over the glen.
The Firth of Forth inspires hearts and minds. 

The taupe salamander sits, vaguely posing 
Alongside one that decidedly favors his broken appendage. 
The woman and her marriage separate, 
A confluence of strife with bitterness outflowing resultantly. 
(The excuse he would give is squirming ironically there.)
In hurried consultation a doctor takes their final payment;
A nurse that is nearby silently takes souls.
A weary child gathers souvenirs of a puzzling day:
Some sermons, an itching that has ended, charity that died.
In reverence she begins evensong, kneeling.
A sergeant undermines an army with countless ludicrous redactions.
Poison ferments within containers so beautiful. 

Yet oftentimes, surprises: 
Surprises a moment's reflection creates 
When on a promontory I taunt everyone with hands aloft. 
Surprises the student receives under a fragile umbrella 
When parting cloudbanks disclose that transitory sun. 
Surprises diameters circumscribe to me 
When pi-based formulas accumulate more pie.
Surprises in a drawing or wrinkled photograph nobody recalled
Unwanted and hidden for a fortnight before 
In pockets of grass-encrusted earth. 
From desperate daily ways we divine a diverting direction, 
As a noteworthy day plucked from a long life. It is simply 
Audacious, tenacious, voracious, vivacious, salacious, judicious, delicious.

## Doubly-true anagram
([overview](#overview))

This one anagrams 30 elements from the Periodic Table of the Elements into 30 other elements (and all 60 elements that appear in the anagram are distinct):

```markdown
hydrogen + zirconium + tin + oxygen + rhenium + platinum +
tellurium + terbium + nobelium + chromium + iron + cobalt +
carbon + aluminum + ruthenium + silicon + ytterbium + hafnium +
sodium + selenium + cerium + manganese + osmium + uranium +
nickel + praseodymium + erbium + vanadium + thallium + plutonium 

=

nitrogen + zinc + rhodium + helium + argon + neptunium +
beryllium + bromine + lutetium + boron + calcium + thorium +
niobium + lanthanum + mercury + fluorine + bismuth + actinium +
silver + cesium + neodymium + magnesium + xenon + samarium +
scandium + europium + berkelium + palladium + antimony + thulium
```

But wait, there's more. Mike thought this wasn't hard enough, so he imposed an additional constraint -- if you replace each element by its atomic number (position in the Periodic Table), there is still equality:

```markdown
1 + 40 + 50 + 8 + 75 + 78 +
52 + 65 +102 + 24 + 26 + 27 +
6 + 13 + 44 + 14 + 70 + 72 +
11 + 34 + 58 + 25 + 76 + 92 +
28 + 59 + 68 + 23 + 81 + 94 

=

7 + 30 + 45 + 2 + 18 + 93 +
4 + 35 + 71 + 5 + 20 + 90 +
41 + 57 + 80 + 9 + 83 + 89 +
47 + 55 + 60 + 12 + 54 + 62 +
21 + 63 + 97 + 46 + 51 + 69 = 1416
```

This is "the longest doubly-true anagram ever constructed using the chemical elements".

## The Wiser Writer and the Inane Reader
([overview](#overview))

A poem about how how James Branch Cabell attained great fame through the writing of (and subsequent obsencity trial surrounding) Jurgen, but never again reached that pinnacle of fame with his subsequent books, written in [Strict Alphametish](http://www.cadaeic.net/alphas.htm): a simple example is SEND MORE MONEY, which works out to 9567 + 1085 = 10652. 

```markdown
   The Wiser Writer and the Inane Reader

He writes at night, serene.
No one, it seems, warms
To his tales of ideal
Love and valor and chance.

As in times past he rearms
Again his genius: Jurgen ensues.

At first, no one sees; no one writes
Of his book or of his risks.
Then Mr. Sumner hisses
"Obscene!", and scene by scene bedecks
Cabell's classic tale with witless
Remarks and asinine fanfare.

There is a trial; fairly easily
Is the case won. As the news echoes within
The land the tale sells and sells . . . and taunts
Its author with odious
Fervor for ever and ever. So fame, snarer
Of souls, takes its fitful
Victim again, as slings
And arrows ever attend reason.

<a name="#The-greatest-con-ever-botched"></a>
## The greatest con ever botched
### by various authors
([overview](#overview))

There's a particular subsubsubgenre of constrained writing best pinpointed in conceptspace by the following joke:

```markdown
What do you call a snobbish criminal going down the stairs? 
A condescending con descending.
```

There's also the famous Buffalo sentence: [Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo). It employs three different meanings of the word ‘buffalo’, and can be more clearly written as “Bison from Buffalo, New York who are intimidated by other bison in their community also happen to intimidate other bison in their community”. 

Note that impressiveness isn’t necessarily a monotonic increasing function of length. Thomas Tymoczko has pointed out that there is nothing special about eight "buffalos"; any sentence consisting solely of the word "buffalo" repeated any number of times is grammatically correct.

It doesn't have to be in English:

```markdown
Although at first glance the single character sentence 子子子子子子子子子子子子 does not seem 
to make sense, when this sentence is read using the right readings of the kanji 子, it means
‘the young of cat, kitten, and the young of lion, cub’. It is told in the work Ujishūi 
Monogatari that the Japanese poet Ono no Takamura used this reading to escape death.
```

Scott Alexander, from [his Tumblr](https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/151794268281/shlevy-slatestarscratchpad-although-at), playing a bit fast and loose with this subgenre's constraints:

```markdown
Once upon a time there was an exotic pet shop by Niagara Falls that got knocked into the 
waterfall by a storm. A bunch of exotic reptiles escaped and washed up on the southern shore.
A lot of them were big and dangerous-looking, so the townspeople demanded that the cops hunt
them down.But in those days the cops used to ride horses, and the horses were terrified of 
the reptiles and threw their riders. There happened to be a Wild West show in town that day,
and the cops figured wild animals might be braver than domesticated ones, so they borrowed 
some bison and rode them around instead and managed to catch most of the escaped reptiles. 
The remaining reptiles all banded together for safety, on the assumption that the cops wouldn’t attack a whole army of them. This proved true, but a couple of smaller iguanas kept wandering off, so the reptiles agreed that any of them who left formation would get eaten by the Komodo dragons. So the cops just set up a CCTV to keep an eye on them and had a few junior officers watch them on screens to make sure they weren’t going anywhere. In other words:

Monitor lizards monitor lizards Buffalo police buffalo police. Police monitors police monitors; Buffalo lizards buffalo lizards.
```

Some time back (in a Facebook comment by Avraham Eisenberg) I [stumbled upon](https://projecteuler.tumblr.com/post/152067337017/voximperatoris-slatestarscratchpad-shlevy) the greatest example of this strange little subgenre of constrained writing that I have ever seen, one so elaborately constructed it simply took my breath away. It builds upon the original ‘condescending’ joke mentioned at the beginning of this post, and in doing so makes the post come full circle; but it complexifies that little joke utterly beyond recognition. It plays loose with the constraint in the manner of Scott. It is utterly *dazzling* to behold. I’ve reproduced it in full below.

```markdown
A swindler passes by a bird in the stairwell of an apartment building. The swindler was headed 
upstairs to visit his friend, the forger. The bird he passed along the way was the forger’s 
homing vulture, which was en route to the forger’s publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately,
the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the 
forger’s apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had
written the perfect end to his prized short story, what’s delivery was a mission of utmost 
importance.

You see, the forger was very proud of this story’s ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two
novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa
Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger’s dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings
in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later
assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.

So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger’s vulture, but he hated birds and went about
swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler
realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him.
As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept
from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and 
take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he leapt
from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him 
on its way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse,
which completely negated Khan’s calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have
been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because
she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan’s midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was
quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting
to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler 
turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had 
successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan’s incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among
his fellow con men as the “greatest con ever botched,” which is far less mentally demanding than what
it was formerly referred to as, which was the “condescending conned ascending con dissenting 
condor-sending condescending con’s descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con’s
dissenting conte’s ending condescending con-dissenting Condi’s ending condescending contes ending 
condescending Khan’s descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending

## Genesis I, alliterative version
### by Doug (and computer program)
([overview](#overview))

I have no idea who 'Doug' is, except that he [probably works at Google Research](http://frederickfiat.com/doug/research/) and [writes many blogs](https://sites.google.com/site/dsummerstay/), one of which is [LLAMAS AND MY STEGOSAURUS](http://llamasandmystegosaurus.blogspot.com/). 

One of his posts is the brilliant [ALPHA (A TRANSLATION OF GENESIS 1)](http://llamasandmystegosaurus.blogspot.com/2017/05/alpha.html). It even attracted Gwern's attention (see comments). Here's how Doug explains it:

```markdown
This was made with the help of a computer program that tries to express the meaning of any word 
by an adjective and a noun pair. Phrases like "abstract astronomy" for "space" and "aquatic 
archipelagos" for "islands" were generated by the program.
```

This is how Doug's program renders the first 31 verses of Genesis:

```markdown
1. An advent: ancient archangels architect abstract astronomy and arid asteroids.  
2. All asteroids are amorphous and absent; And all asleep across aquatic anarchy. 
And astral angels advanced across area. 
3. And Almighty asked," Appear." And all appeared aglow. 
4. And Almighty approved. Aura and absence: an antagonistic arithmetic. 
5. An afternoon and aurora, an aeon. 
6.And atmosphere and all awash abscinded. 
7. Astral air above; aquatic area abased. All as Almighty asserted. 
8. Angel's abode appeared. Another afternoon, another aurora. Another aeon.
9. And Almighty authored aquatic archipelagos. Arable acreage appeared. 
10. And Almighty approved. 
11. Abundant agricultural affluence: azaleas, anise, amaranth. And apples and apricots,
almonds and acacias, an arboreal appearance. 
12. As asked, all appeared. And Almighty Aleph assessed, and admired. 
13. Another afternoon, another aurora. Another age.
14. And Almighty asked, "Astronomical atmosphere ablaze, aglow, an auroral aubade.
Aurora and afternoon apportioned asunder. Add annual analemmas and anniverseries." 
15. And all atmosphere appeared aglow. 
16. Apollo's aura, alighted; Artemis's after, alighted. All astral achieved actuality.
17. And Almighty affixed astronomy and alighted all. 
18. And all aglow adminstered alloted ages and anniverseries. And Almighty approved.
19. An afternoon and an aurora, again an age.
20. And Almighty added, "Abyss, abundantly advance all animals: albacore and alligators,
anemones and anchovies, angelfish and anglers; and avians assemble above air: all 
albatrosses and auks. 
21. And Almighty assembled awesome abyssal animals; all alive, ascending and abasing, 
abyss advanced abundantly. And air afforded all avian.
22. And Almighty anointed all, and announced, "Amplify and accumulate, abyss and air,

23. An afternoon and an aurora, another age.
24. And across all areas, animals assemble. Asses, aardvarks and antelopes appear. 
"Aphids, an ant army, arachnids, all ambling animals: Appear!"
25. Arthropods and amblers arose: and Almighty approved.
26. And Almighty advocated assembling anthropic anatomy, after Almighty ancestor's 
appearance, allowing adminstration and ascendancy above all animals.
27. Almighty animated Adam, affixing Almighty's aspect and appearance. Adam and Ava are

28. Anointing Adam and Ava, Almighty asked,"Abound, and ascend above all, and administrate
all animals-- appointed above all abyssal, aerial, and ambulatory animals.
29. "Attend: all agricultural, and arboreal apples, apricots, almonds appease an appetite.
30. And all abyssal, aerial, and ambling animals are accommodated aliment."
31. And Almighty apprehended all, and approved all as acceptable. And another afternoon 
and aurora approached another age.

How Doug used word2vec in the translation of Genesis into words beginning with the letter A, in response to Gwern's query:

```markdown
I used the word2vec vectors trained by Mikolov on the Google News corpus. I found a list of 
adjectives and a list of nouns beginning with the letter A, and formed all possible pairs of 
the two, adding the vector of the adjective to the vector of the noun. Then I took a term I 
was interested in, and found which adjective-noun pair was most similar to the vector for that
term. So if I put in "god" it might say "almighty archangel" or if I put in "island" it might 
come back with "aquatic archipelago."

(I've since come up with a more memory efficient way of doing this using sparse decomposition,
but that's the method I used at the time.) I also did the same with verbs and adverbs. 

I picked through the top twenty or so results for a term and chose the ones I liked the best,
as I went through the translation. It was just a tool I used for ideas, not something I could 
turn loose and let it do the full translation itself.

One of the hardest parts to figure out was "sun" and "moon"-- I made reference to Artemis and 
Apollo, which come from the wrong mythology, but it was the best I could figure out.

I used the same tech to make rhyming pairs of words that have a particular meaning. Here's a 
list of some of my favorite results from that program:

cowboy: colorado desperado
llama: coat goat
Star_Wars: groovy movie, halloween onscreen, iconic hypersonic, cute reboot, droid overjoyed, etc...
friar: yeast priest, barbarian seminarian
spaceship: moon balloon
pillow: head bed
trampoline: elastic gymnastic
rocking chair: knitter sitter
weed: vegetation eradication
novel: fiction depiction
juice: dilute fruit
cookie: naughty biscotti
Oreo: black snack
orca: dalmation cetacean
Mad Max: futuristic sadistic
oven: boiler broiler, roaster toaster
clock: chimes times
stopwatch: clocks jocks, elapse laps
dragon: wizard lizard
Lost_Ark: horror explorer
brain: logical neurological
Lincoln: desegregation oration
Beatles: guitars superstars
honey: bees cheese
flower: bloom perfume, frilly lily
Clinton: she nominee
sun: skylight twilight
Bollywood: Hindi indie, Delhi telly
```

## A new kind of review
### by 'a reader'
([overview](#overview))

An Amazon book review of Stephen Wolfram's *A New Kind of Science* whose original copy no longer exists online; Googling turned up [this page](http://shell.cas.usf.edu/~wclark/ANKOS_humor.html), and I'm reposting here. 

```markdown
**A New Kind of Review**
by "a reader"

I can only imagine how fortunate you must feel to be reading my review. This review is the product of my lifetime of experience in meeting important people and thinking deep thoughts. This is a new kind of review, and will no doubt influence the way you think about the world around you and the way you think of yourself.

**Bigger than infinity** Although my review deserves thousands of pages to articulate, I am limiting many of my deeper thoughts to only single characters. I encourage readers of my review to dedicate the many years required to fully absorb the significance of what I am writing here. Fortunately, we live in exactly the time when my review can be widely disseminated by "internet" 
technology and stored on "digital media", allowing current and future scholars to delve more deeply into my original and insightful use of commas, numbers, and letters.

**My place in history** My review allows, for the first time, a complete and total understanding not only of this but *every single* book ever written. I call this "the principle of book equivalence." Future generations will decide the relative merits of this review compared with, for example, the works of Shakespeare. This effort will open new realms of scholarship.

**More about me** I first began writing reviews as a small child, where my talent was clearly apparent to those around me, including my mother. She preserved my early writings which, although simpler in structure, portend elements of my current style. I include one of them below (which I call review 30) to indicate the scholarly pedigree of the document now in your hands or on your screen or committed to your memory:

*"The guy who wrote the book is also the publisher of the book. I guess he's the only person smart enough to understand what's in it. When I'm older I too will use a vanity press. Then I can write all the pages I want."...*

It is staggering to contemplate that all the great works of literature can be derived from the letters I use in writing this review. I am pleased to have shared them with you, and hereby grant you the liberty to use up to twenty (20) of them consecutively without attribution. Any use of additional characters in print must acknowledge this review as source material since it contains, implicitly or explicitly, all future written documents.

## Don't Become a Well-Rounded Person
### by Bruce Sterling
([overview](#overview))

Found this passage in Cosma Shalizi's [notebook entry](http://bactra.org/Sterling/) on Sterling, itself sourced from ["The Wonderful Power of Storytelling"](http://www.eff.org/pub/Global/America-US/Publications/Bruce_Sterling/comp_game_designers.article) (link now rotten):

```markdown
Don't become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly
spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish.

If you want to woo the muse of the odd, don't read Shakespeare. Read Webster's revenge plays.
Don't read Homer and Aristotle. Read Herodotus where he's off talking about Egyptian women 
having public sex with goats.

If you want to read about myth don't read Joseph Campbell, read about convulsive religion, read
about voodoo and the Millerites and the Munster Anabaptists. There are hundreds of years of 
extremities, there are vast legacies of mutants. There have always been geeks. There will always
be geeks.

Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors were. You didn't come here 
from nowhere. There are reasons why you're here. Learn those reasons. Learn about the stuff that
was buried because it was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable.

## Three Men in a Boat
### by Jerome K. Jerome
([overview](#overview))

Original essay [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/308/308-h/308-h.htm).

```markdown
It is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine advertisement without 
being impelled to the conclusion that I am suffering from the particular disease therein
dealt with in its most virulent form.  The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly
with all the sensations that I have ever felt.

I remember going to the British Museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailment
of which I had a touch—hay fever, I fancy it was.  I got down the book, and read all I came to
read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the leaves, and began to indolently 
study diseases, generally.  I forget which was the first distemper I plunged into—some fearful,
devastating scourge, I know—and, before I had glanced half down the list of “premonitory 
symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.

I sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of despair, I again turned
over the pages.  I came to typhoid fever—read the symptoms—discovered that I had typhoid fever,
must have had it for months without knowing it—wondered what else I had got; turned up St.
Vitus’s Dance—found, as I expected, that I had that too,—began to get interested in my case, 
and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started alphabetically—read up ague, and learnt 
that I was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.
Bright’s disease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so far as that
was concerned, I might live for years.  Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria
I seemed to have been born with.  I plodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, 
and the only malady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid’s knee.

I felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight.  Why hadn’t
I got housemaid’s knee?  Why this invidious reservation?  After a while, however, less grasping
feelings prevailed.  I reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and 
I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid’s knee.  Gout, in its most malignant
stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently
been suffering with from boyhood.  There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded 
there was nothing else the matter with me.

I sat and pondered.  I thought what an interesting case I must be from a medical point of view,
what an acquisition I should be to a class!  Students would have no need to “walk the hospitals,”
if they had me.  I was a hospital in myself.  All they need do would be to walk round me, and, 
after that, take their diploma. ...

I had walked into that reading-room a happy, healthy man.  I crawled out a decrepit wreck.

## Total Eclipse
### by Annie Dillard
([overview](#overview))

Original essay [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/annie-dillards-total-eclipse/536148/). I consider this truly great writing.

On a painting of a smiling clown’s head made of vegetables, hung in the hotel room Dillard and her husband stayed at while waiting for the eclipse:

```markdown
I lay in bed. My husband, Gary, was reading beside me. I lay in bed and looked at the 
painting on the hotel room wall.

It was a print of a detailed and lifelike painting of a smiling clown’s head, made out 
of vegetables. It was a painting of the sort which you do not intend to look at, and which,
alas, you never forget. Some tasteless fate presses it upon you; it becomes part of the
complex interior junk you carry with you wherever you go. Two years have passed since the 
total eclipse of which I write. During those years I have forgotten, I assume, a great many
things I wanted to remember—but I have not forgotten that clown painting or its lunatic
setting in the old hotel.

The clown was bald. Actually, he wore a clown’s tight rubber wig, painted white; this 
stretched over the top of his skull, which was a cabbage. His hair was bunches of baby 
carrots. Inset in his white clown makeup, and in his cabbage skull, were his small and
laughing human eyes. The clown’s glance was like the glance of Rembrandt in some of the 
self-portraits: lively, knowing, deep, and loving. The crinkled shadows around his eyes were 
string beans. His eyebrows were parsley. Each of his ears was a broad bean. His thin, joyful
lips were red chili peppers; between his lips were wet rows of human teeth and a suggestion 
of a real tongue. The clown print was framed in gilt and glassed.
```

Up on that grassy hill, waiting for the moon to eclipse the dawning sun:

```markdown
Now the sun was up. We could not see it; but the sky behind the band of clouds was yellow, 
and, far down the valley, some hillside orchards had lighted up.

More people were parking near the highway and climbing the hills. It was the West. All of us
rugged individualists were wearing knit caps and blue nylon parkas. People were climbing the
nearby hills and setting up shop in clumps among the dead grasses. It looked as though we had 
all gathered on hilltops to pray for the world on its last day. It looked as though we had all 
crawled out of spaceships and were preparing to assault the valley below. It looked as though
we were scattered on hilltops at dawn to sacrifice virgins, make rain, set stone stelae in a ring.

There was no place out of the wind. The straw grasses banged our legs. Up in the sky where we
stood the air was lusterless yellow. To the west the sky was blue.

Now the sun cleared the clouds. We cast rough shadows on the blowing grass; freezing, we waved
our arms. Near the sun, the sky was bright and colorless. There was nothing to see.
```

The eclipse itself:

```markdown
Now the sky to the west deepened to indigo, a color never seen. A dark sky usually loses color.
This was a saturated, deep indigo, up in the air. Stuck up into that unworldly sky was the cone 
of Mount Adams, and the alpenglow was upon it. The alpenglow is that red light of sunset which 
holds out on snowy mountaintops long after the valleys and tablelands are dimmed. “Look at Mount
Adams,” I said, and that was the last sane moment I remember.

I turned back to the sun. It was going. The sun was going, and the world was wrong. The grasses 
were wrong; they were platinum. Their every detail of stem, head, and blade shone lightless and 
artificially distinct as an art photographer’s platinum print. This color has never been seen on 
Earth. The hues were metallic; their finish was matte. The hillside was a 19th-century tinted 
photograph from which the tints had faded. All the people you see in the photograph, distinct and
detailed as their faces look, are now dead. The sky was navy blue. My hands were silver. All the
distant hills’ grasses were finespun metal which the wind laid down. I was watching a faded color
print of a movie filmed in the Middle Ages; I was standing in it, by some mistake. I was standing 
in a movie of hillside grasses filmed in the Middle Ages. I missed my own century, the people I 
knew, and the real light of day.

I looked at Gary. He was in the film. Everything was lost. He was a platinum print, a dead artist’s
version of life. I saw on his skull the darkness of night mixed with the colors of day. My mind was
going out; my eyes were receding the way galaxies recede to the rim of space. Gary was light-years 
away, gesturing inside a circle of darkness, down the wrong end of a telescope. He smiled as if he 
saw me; the stringy crinkles around his eyes moved. The sight of him, familiar and wrong, was 
something I was remembering from centuries hence, from the other side of death: Yes, that is the way
he used to look, when we were living. When it was our generation’s turn to be alive. I could not hea
r him; the wind was too loud. Behind him the sun was going. We had all started down a chute of time.
At first it was pleasant; now there was no stopping it. Gary was chuting away across space, moving 
and talking and catching my eye, chuting down the long corridor of separation. The skin on his face 
moved like thin bronze plating that would peel. …

From all the hills came screams. A piece of sky beside the crescent sun was detaching. It was a 
loosened circle of evening sky, suddenly lighted from the back. It was an abrupt black body out of
nowhere; it was a flat disk; it was almost over the sun. That is when there were screams. At once 
this disk of sky slid over the sun like a lid. The sky snapped over the sun like a lens cover. The
hatch in the brain slammed. Abruptly it was dark night, on the land and in the sky. In the night 
sky was a tiny ring of light. The hole where the sun belongs is very small. A thin ring of light 
marked its place. There was no sound. The eyes dried, the arteries drained, the lungs hushed. There
was no world. We were the world’s dead people rotating and orbiting around and around, embedded in
the planet’s crust, while the Earth rolled down. Our minds were light-years distant, forgetful of 
almost everything. Only an extraordinary act of will could recall to us our former, living selves 
and our contexts in matter and time. We had, it seems, loved the planet and loved our lives, but
could no longer remember the way of them. We got the light wrong. In the sky was something that 
should not be there. In the black sky was a ring of light. It was a thin ring, an old, thin silver
wedding band, an old, worn ring. It was an old wedding band in the sky, or a morsel of bone. 
There were stars. It was all over.
```

More:

```markdown
I saw, early in the morning, the sun diminish against a backdrop of sky. I saw a circular piece
of that sky appear, suddenly detached, blackened, and backlighted; from nowhere it came and 
overlapped the sun. It did not look like the moon. It was enormous and black. If I had not read 
that it was the moon, I could have seen the sight a hundred times and never thought of the moon 
once. (If, however, I had not read that it was the moon—if, like most of the world’s people 
throughout time, I had simply glanced up and seen this thing—then I doubtless would not have 
speculated much, but would have, like Emperor Louis of Bavaria in 840, simply died of fright on
the spot.) It did not look like a dragon, although it looked more like a dragon than the moon. 
It looked like a lens cover, or the lid of a pot. It materialized out of thin air—black, and flat,
and sliding, outlined in flame.

Seeing this black body was like seeing a mushroom cloud. The heart screeched. The meaning of the 
sight overwhelmed its fascination. It obliterated meaning itself. If you were to glance out one 
day and see a row of mushroom clouds rising on the horizon, you would know at once that what you
were seeing, remarkable as it was, was intrinsically not worth remarking. No use running to tell
anyone. Significant as it was, it did not matter a whit. For what is significance? It is 
significance for people. No people, no significance. This is all I have to tell you.

In the deeps are the violence and terror of which psychology has warned us. But if you ride these 
monsters deeper down, if you drop with them farther over the world’s rim, you find what our sciences
cannot locate or name, the substrate, the ocean or matrix or ether which buoys the rest, which gives
goodness its power for good, and evil. Its power for evil, the unified field: our complex and 
inexplicable caring for each other, and for our life together here. This is given. It is not learned.

The world which lay under darkness and stillness following the closing of the lid was not the
world we know. The event was over. Its devastation lay around about us. The clamoring mind and 
heart stilled, almost indifferent, certainly disembodied, frail, and exhausted. The hills were 
hushed, obliterated. Up in the sky, like a crater from some distant cataclysm, was a hollow ring.

You have seen photographs of the sun taken during a total eclipse. The corona fills the print. 
All of those photographs were taken through telescopes. The lenses of telescopes and cameras can 
no more cover the breadth and scale of the visual array than language can cover the breadth and 
simultaneity of internal experience. Lenses enlarge the sight, omit its context, and make of it a 
pretty and sensible picture, like something on a Christmas card. I assure you, if you send any 
shepherds a Christmas card on which is printed a three-by-three photograph of the angel of the Lord,
the glory of the Lord, and a multitude of the heavenly host, they will not be sore afraid. More 
fearsome things can come in envelopes. More moving photographs than those of the sun’s corona can 
appear in magazines. But I pray you will never see anything more awful in the sky.

You see the wide world swaddled in darkness; you see a vast breadth of hilly land, and an enormous,
distant, blackened valley; you see towns’ lights, a river’s path, and blurred portions of your hat
and scarf; you see your husband’s face looking like an early black-and-white film; and you see a 
sprawl of black sky and blue sky together, with unfamiliar stars in it, some barely visible bands
of cloud, and over there, a small white ring. The ring is as small as one goose in a flock of 
migrating geese—if you happen to notice a flock of migrating geese. It is one-360th part of the 
visible sky. The sun we see is less than half the diameter of a dime held at arm’s length.

The Crab Nebula, in the constellation Taurus, looks, through binoculars, like a smoke ring. It is
a star in the process of exploding. Light from its explosion first reached the Earth in 1054; it
was a supernova then, and so bright it shone in the daytime. Now it is not so bright, but it is 
still exploding. It expands at the rate of 70 million miles a day. It is interesting to look through
binoculars at something expanding 70 million miles a day. It does not budge. Its apparent size
does not increase. Photographs of the Crab Nebula taken 15 years ago seem identical to photographs
of it taken yesterday. Some lichens are similar. Botanists have measured some ordinary lichens twice,
at 50-year intervals, without detecting any growth at all. And yet their cells divide; they live.

The small ring of light was like these things—like a ridiculous lichen up in the sky, like a 
perfectly still explosion 4,200 light-years away: It was interesting, and lovely, and in witless
motion, and it had nothing to do with anything.

It had nothing to do with anything. The sun was too small, and too cold, and too far away, to
keep the world alive. The white ring was not enough. It was feeble and worthless. It was as 
useless as a memory; it was as off-kilter and hollow and wretched as a memory.

When you try your hardest to recall someone’s face, or the look of a place, you see in your mind’s
eye some vague and terrible sight such as this. It is dark; it is insubstantial; it is all wrong.

The white ring and the saturated darkness made the Earth and the sky look as they must look in 
the memories of the careless dead. What I saw, what I seemed to be standing in, was all the 
wrecked light that the memories of the dead could shed upon the living world. We had all died in
our boots on the hilltops of Yakima, and were alone in eternity. Empty space stoppered our eyes
and mouths; we cared for nothing. We remembered our living days wrong. With great effort we had
remembered some sort of circular light in the sky—but only the outline. Oh, and then the orchard 
trees withered, the ground froze, the glaciers slid down the valleys and overlapped the towns. 
If there had ever been people on Earth, nobody knew it. The dead had forgotten those they had 
loved. The dead were parted one from the other and could no longer remember the faces and lands
they had loved in the light. They seemed to stand on darkened hilltops, looking down.
```

Remembering, and the sheer stupefying scale of the cosmos:

Further: While the mind reels in deep space, while the mind grieves or fears or exults, the workaday
senses, in ignorance or idiocy, like so many computer terminals printing out market prices while the
world blows up, still transcribe their little data and transmit them to the warehouse in the skull.
Later, under the tranquilizing influence of fried eggs, the mind can sort through this data. The 
restaurant was a halfway house, a decompression chamber. There I remembered a few things more.

The deepest, and most terrifying, was this: I have said that I heard screams. (I have since read that
screaming, with hysteria, is a common reaction even to expected total eclipses.) People on all the 
hillsides, including, I think, myself, screamed when the black body of the moon detached from the sky 
and rolled over the sun. But something else was happening at that same instant, and it was this, I 
believe, which made us scream.

The second before the sun went out we saw a wall of dark shadow come speeding at us. We no sooner saw 
it than it was upon us, like thunder. It roared up the valley. It slammed our hill and knocked us out.
It was the monstrous swift shadow cone of the moon. I have since read that this wave of shadow moves 
1,800 miles an hour. Language can give no sense of this sort of speed—1,800 miles an hour. It was 195
miles wide. No end was in sight—you saw only the edge. It rolled at you across the land at 1,800 miles
an hour, hauling darkness like plague behind it. Seeing it, and knowing it was coming straight for you,
was like feeling a slug of anesthetic shoot up your arm. If you think very fast, you may have time to 
think, “Soon it will hit my brain.” You can feel the deadness race up your arm; you can feel the appalling,
inhuman speed of your own blood. We saw the wall of shadow coming, and screamed before it hit.

This was the universe about which we have read so much and never before felt: the universe as a clockwork
of loose spheres flung at stupefying, unauthorized speeds. How could anything moving so fast not crash,
not veer from its orbit amok like a car out of control on a turn?

Less than two minutes later, when the sun emerged, the trailing edge of the shadow cone sped away. It 
coursed down our hill and raced eastward over the plain, faster than the eye could believe; it swept
over the plain and dropped over the planet’s rim in a twinkling. It had clobbered us, and now it roared
away. We blinked in the light. It was as though an enormous, loping god in the sky had reached down and
slapped the Earth’s face.

## Lies
### by Alan Crowe
([overview](#overview))

Original essay [here](http://www.cawtech.freeserve.co.uk/lies.2.html).

```markdown
It is a poor lie that is a farrago of falsehood, whose only connections to the truth are 
a camouflage of verisimilitude calculated to further the deception. The art of lying lies 
in abundant and creative truthfulness. The victim goes to his grave asking "How did that 
happen? Everything we checked was true and we thought we had checked everything."

There is a moral tale to tell, about how liars are undone. Not by being caught and punished,
oh no, not that, but by losing the key. Forgetting "where the bodies are buried", forgetting
to remove the rotten apple from the barrel, the liar loses sight of the few, key falsehoods
that unlock the whole deception and becomes a victim: a believer in his own lie.

That is not the tale I wish to tell, for it is itself a lie.

The true tragedy of the human condition is self-deception. The reason that we do not see 
through the lies of those who deceive us is because they come with a double helping of comfy
coziness. The lies feel comfortable and cozy because they were constructed that way, to meet
our emotional needs. Believing them feels comfortable and cozy a second way, due to the 
warmth of the familiar. Believing falsehoods to meet our emotional needs is how we live, even
when no-one tries to deceive others.

The liar is not caught and punished for few truly resent the false comfort he brings. Nor 
does it matter if he believes his own lies. His life is built on unconscious untruths of which
he is unaware. Suppose that a consciously constructed untruth, designed to further his own 
interests, were somehow to convince and take its place besides unconscious self-deception, 
how what that be different?

The true danger lies in abandoning the fight against self-deception. Deceiving others is hard 
work, and takes time and effort. The fight against self-deception is starved of resources. 
Worse still, the fight against self-deception is starved of legitimacy. While we work hard, 
carefully concealing the truth that we know from others whom we wish to deceive, what chance 
have we of realizing that our truth is itself a lie, deceiving us. Self-doubt may save us from
self inflicted disaster, but no-one can manage the convoluted thinking needed to doubt the 
"truths" that we are taking pains to conceal from others. We live external lives, jousting with
others, piercing their lies with our lance, defending our own lies with our shield.

We are each of us like a king defended against foreign enemies by a formidable army. The King 
stands on the tall battlements of his castle, looking out towards the far horizon, glancing at 
the vertiginous drop, secure in the knowledge that no foe could scale such mountainous ramparts.
One day his son will push him off.

## Bistromathic Drive
### by Douglas Adams
([overview](#overview))

"The Bistromathic Drive," wrote Douglas Adams in *Life, The Universe and Everything*, "is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors". 

Its inner workings are founded upon the principles of "Bistromathics":

```markdown
Numbers written on restaurant checks within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same
mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe. 

This single statement took the scientific world by storm....

Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behavior of numbers.
Just as Einstein observed that space was not an absolute but depended upon the observer's movement 
in space, and that time was not an absolute, but depended upon the observer's movement in time, so 
it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend upon the observer's movement in restaurants. 
```

The protagonists' introduction to the Bistromathic Drive is particularly memorable:

```markdown
What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford shook his head, buried his 
face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall. 

"The central computational area," said Slartibartfast, unperturbed. "This is where every 
calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed. Yes, I know what it looks like, but it
is in fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex 
mathematical functions."

"It looks like a joke," said Arthur. 

"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As he did so, Arthur had a 
sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but he refused to believe it. The Universe could not
possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as
absurd as, as absurd as . . . he terminated that line of thinking. Most of the absurd things he
could think of had already happened. 

And this was one of them.

It was a large glass cage, or box - in fact a room. 

In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a dozen chairs, of the bentwood
style. On it was a tablecloth - a grubby, red-and-white check tablecloth, scarred with the 
occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a precisely calculated mathematical position. 

And on the tablecloth sat some dozen half-eaten Italian meals, hedged about with half-eaten 
breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots. 

It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended by a robot waiter, a robot
wine waiter and a robot maitre d'. The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial and
each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics
of, say, a pollo sorpreso, without actually being one. 

And all participated in a little dance together - a complex routine involving the manipulation 
of menus, check pads, wallets, check books, credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, 
which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere. 

Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the 
maitre d', while one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning 
what he intended to do to some guy over some girl. 

Slartibartfast took over the seat that had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu.
The tempo of the routine around the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken, Arguments broke 
out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved fiercely at each other, and attempted
to examine each other's pieces of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the check pad more 
quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly than a human eye could follow. The
pace accelerated. Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and 
seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved. A new vibration thrilled
through the ship. 

Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room. 

"Bistromathics," he said, "the most powerful computational force known to parascience."
```

Here's Slartibartfast trying to explain to Arthur Dent why all the ship's computations were being done on a waiter's check pad:

```markdown
"Listen," he said, "on a waiter's check pad numbers dance. You must have encountered the 
phenomenon."

"Well . . ."

"On a waiter's check pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and unreality collide on such a
fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters."

"What parameters?"

"It's impossible to say," said Slartibartfast. "That's one of them. Strange but true. At least
I think it's strange," he added, "and I am assured it's true."

## Mystical interpretation of a car
### by Umberto Eco
([overview](#overview))

From a passage in Umberto Eco's book *Foucault's Pendulum*, chapter 66:

```markdown
“Last night I happened to come across a driver’s manual. Maybe it was the semidarkness, or what 
you had said to me, but I began to imagine that those pages were saying Something Else. Suppose
the automobile existed only to serve as metaphor of creation? And we mustn’t confine ourselves 
to the exterior, or to the surface reality of the dashboard; we must learn to see what only the
Maker sees, what lies beneath. What lies beneath and what lies above. It is the Tree of the Sefirot.”

“You don’t say.”

“I am not the one who says; it is the thing itself that says. The drive shaft is the trunk of 
the tree. Count the parts: engine, 2 front wheels, clutch, transmission, two axles, differential, 
and 2 rear wheels. Ten parts, ten Sefirot.”

“But the positions don’t coincide.”

“Who says they don’t? Diotallevi explained to us that in certain versions Tiferet isn’t the sixth
Sefirah, but the eighth, below Nezah and Hod. My axle-tree is the tree of Belboth.”

“Fiat.”

“But let’s pursue the dialectic of the tree. At the summit is the engine, Omnia Movens, of which
more later: this is the Creative Source. The engine communicates its creative energy to the 2 
front or higher wheels: the Wheel of Intelligence and the Wheel of Knowledge.”

“If the car has front-wheel drive.”

“The good thing about the Belboth tree is that it allows metaphysical alternatives. So we have 
the image of a spiritual cosmos with front-wheel-drive, where the engine, in front, transmits 
its wishes to the higher wheels, whereas in the materialistic version we have a degenerate cosmos
in which motion is imparted by the engine to the 2 lower wheels: from the depths, the cosmic 
emanation releases the base forces of matter.”

“What about an engine in back, rear-wheel drive?”

“Satanic. Higher and lower coincide. God is identified with the motion of crude matter. God as
an eternally frustrated aspiration to divinity. The result of the Breaking of the Vessels (tsim-sun).”

“Not the Breaking of the Muffler?”

“That occurs in aborted universes, where the noxious breath of the Archons spreads through the
ether. But we mustn’t digress. After the engine and 2 wheels comes the clutch, the Sefirah of 
grace that establishes or interrupts the flow of love that binds the rest of the tree of the 
Supernal Energy. A disk, a mandala that caresses another mandala. Then the coffer of change – 
the gear box, or transmission, as the positivists call it, which is the principle of Evil,
because it allows human will to speed up or slow down the constant process of emanation. For 
this reason, an automatic transmission costs more, for there it is the tree itself that decides,
in accordance with its own Sovereign Equilibrium. Then comes the universal joint, the axle, the
drive shaft, the differential–note the opposition/repetition of the quaternion of cylinders in
the engine, because the differential (Minor Keter) transmits motion to the earthly wheels. Here
the function of the Sefirah of difference is obvious, as, with a majestic sense of beauty, it
distributes the cosmic forces to the Wheel of Glory and the Wheel of Victory, which in an 
unaborted universe (front-wheel drive) are subordinate to the motion imparted by the higher wheels.”

“A coherent exegesis. And the heart of the engine, seat of the One, the Crown?”

“You have but to look with the eyes of an initiate. The supreme engine lives by an alternation 
of intake and exhaust. A complex, divine respiration, a cycle initially based on 2 units called 
cylinders (an obvious geometrical archetype), which then generate a third, and finally gaze upon
one another in mutual love and bring forth the glory of a fourth. In the cycle of the first 
cylinder (none is first hierarchically, but only through the miraculous alternation of position),
the piston (etymology: Pistis Sophia) descends from the upper neutral position to the lower
neutral position as the cylinder fills with energy in the pure state. I’m simplifying, because 
here angelic hierarchies come into play, the valves, which, as my handbook says, ‘allow the 
opening and closing of the apertures that link the interior of the cylinders to the induction 
pipes leading out of the carburetor.’ The inner seat of the engine can communicate with the rest
of the cosmos only through this mediation, and here I believe is revealed – I am reluctant to 
utter heresy – the original limit of the One, which, in order to create, somehow depends on the 
Great Eccentrics. A closer reading of the text may be required here. The cylinder fills with 
energy, the piston returns to the upper neutral position and achieves maximum compression–the 
tsim-sun. And lo, the glory of the Big Bang: combustion, expansion. A spark flies, the mixture 
of fuel flares and blazes, and this the handbook calls the active phase of the cycle. And woe,
woe if in the mixture of fuel the Shells intrude, the qelippot, drops of impure matter like water
or Coca-Cola. Then expansion does not take place or occurs in abortive starts…”

“Then the meaning of Shell is qelippot? We’d better not use it anymore. From now on, only 
Virgin’s Milk…”

“We’ll check. It could be a trick of the Seven Sisters, lower emanations trying to control the 
process of creation…In any case, after expansion, behold the great divine release, the exhaust.
The piston rises again to the upper neutral position and expels the formless matter, now
combusted. Only if this process of purification succeeds can the new cycle begin. Which, if you
think about it, is also the Neoplatonic mechanism of Exodus and Parodos, miraculous dialectic
of the Way Up and the Way Down.”

“Quantum mortalia pectora ceacae noctis habent! And the sons of matter never realized it!”

“They never saw the connection between the philosopher’s stone and Firestone.”

“For tomorrow, I’ll prepare a mystical interpretation of the phone book.”

## Dreamtigers
### by Jorge Louis Borges
([overview](#overview))

*Dreamtigers* is a collection of short essays, poems and literary sketches examining the limits of creativity which Borges considered his most personal work. Here's how it begins:

```markdown
God grant that the essential monotony of this miscellany (which time has compiled - not I - and
which admits past pieces that I have not dared to revise, because I wrote them with a different 
concept of literature) be less evident than the geographical and historical diversity of its themes. 

Of all the books I have delivered to the presses, none, I think, is as personal as the straggling
collection mustered for this hodgepodge, precisely because it abounds in reflections and
interpolations. Few things have happened to me, and I have read a great many. Or rather, few 
things have happened to me more worth remembering than Schopenhauer’s thought or the music of 
England’s words.

A man sets himself the task of portraying the world. Through the years he peoples a space with images
of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, instruments, stars, horses,
and people. Shortly before his death, he discovers that that patient labyrinth of lines traces 
the image of his face.

## Ham radio
### by iceowl
([overview](#overview))

Oh [iceowl](http://everything2.com/user/iceowl), you beautiful, beautiful writer. [September 9, 2013](http://everything2.com/title/September+9,+2013?author_id=1269886#iceowl) is one of the most beautiful stories I’ve read in a long time. I could quote whole paragraphs, whole passages even.

This is the ham radio quote that touched my very soul:

```markdown
I remember radio.

I remember watching my uncle wrap magnet wire around an old oatmeal box and having him tell me 
we'd tune with it, and then pressing the black bakelite headphone to my ear and in my own
backyard, next to the tomato plants between the swimming pool and the fence that was a ground
even though it was a fence: hearing a man speak in a British voice about things important to 
people who lived beyond that thin line that separated water and sky beyond the sandy beach.

I remember that radio was lightning: action at a distance -- that with it we'd connect with
people who stood with feet bare in jungles we'd never see, upon sands we'd never touch, who knew
summers during our winters and told of time that ran through days we'd yet to live, or just had.
We hear English accented by mother tongues on continents alive to us only in books or grainy film.
We'd bathe in that violation of time and space that limited our waking hours to bedtime and dinner
time and the interminable school room clock whose hands slowed as they approached three. They 
thrived while we slept. Needed umbrellas during our sunshine. Ate unnameable foods, and called 
themselves things that sounded as if out of alien bibles. Because nobody we knew had ever been
anywhere, or spoke anything, or knew anything other than our neighborhood where we all lived, and 
English that we all spoke.
```

Loss:

```markdown
Radio was over when I met a friend at a professional convention and he asked me about it. Was I 
active?

Not only had I not been active since we'd last spoken years before and I didn't have an antenna 
up for any band, anywhere.

Worst of all, I couldn't remember my gear. I knew I had some. I could envision it in my mind, but
for the life of me I couldn't remember the designator.

"I haven't got out the old ICOM IC-1532 in a long time."

"I'll bet. What the heck is that, anyway?"

I looked at my shoes. They were still on my feet. Yes, they were. I said to him, while making 
sure I didn't lose my shoes, "Can you believe I can't remember what type of HF rig I have?"

"Come on. You have to come back. How can you stay away?"

I wanted to tell him it was pretty easy. I yanked my iPhone out of my pocket. "I can play 
Scrabble with people in Vietnam and Armenia at the same time..."

"Oh, put that away. I'm sick of hearing things like that. I know what you're going through. I've
seen it in a lot of guys. You get older. Life changes and technology grows. It's satellite TV and
3D first-person video games. Sure. But radio is eternal. It's a fundamental law of physics. We 
didn't create it, and we can't kill it. It called you. Just like the rest of us. And look, we 
have all these cool digital modes. The gear is better than it's ever been. But that's not the
reason to come back. Take a minute and think back. Don't you remember radio? Don't you remember 
how it felt when you started?"

"I was very young."

"We all were. It starts when you're young. And what about our kids?"

"They'd rather learn object oriented programming."

"Because nobody's showing them that you can still send data around the world with a CW key, some
wire, and a three-volt battery."

"A lemon," I said. "You could do it QRP with a lemon and a rusted razor blade. But I think those
days are over, my friend. For them. For us. We're just dead guys who don't realize it yet."

"Oh, cut it out. You used to love CW. Come to field day. I'll put you in front of a CW station 
for 10 minutes and you'll forget you ever said any of that."

"Don't think so," I said. We shook hands. I never showed at ARRL Field day.
```

Revelation:

```markdown
"Why are you a ham?" I asked him.

"I like radio," he said.

"And why is that?" I said. And he shrugged, and the other guys shrugged and looked around as if 
an answer was crawling around somewhere in the store.

"You know, I went to Antarctica on a science expedition for the National Science Foundation," 
I said. "I'd always wanted to go there. Ever since I remember. As a kid I read all the books about
Shackleton and Scott and Mawson. In fact, the first short story I ever had published was in QST in
the early 1990s and it was about the two things that I loved most in the world: ham radio, and 
polar exploration. Well, ten years later I got a shot at going to Antarctica and the pole so I took
it. And the first day I was in Antarctica was like I had stepped into a dream that I'd been having 
most of my life.

"Well, I went to one of the bars they have there at McMurdo station, and I sat down and ordered a 
beer. And one of the guys who was there came up to me, recognizing that I was new, and introduced 
himself. He said to me, 'ok, so why are you here?' and I told him about the project I was on. But
he said, 'No. I mean, why are you HERE?'"

I paused to see if any of them wanted to jump in with the answer, but they didn't. Eventually the
counterman said, "So?"

I said, "So I told him I didn't have a clue why I was there. Only that I had felt compelled to be
there for my entire life. I don't know why. And when it came my time to go to Antarctica all the 
pieces fell into place as if it were magic. And I was there. And you know what he told me? He said
that everyone - all of them in that bar were there at that moment for the same reason. We all knew
from the time we were kids that we just had to go to Antarctica and when it came time to go, the 
fates turned their wheels and there we were."

A couple guys nodded, if only to be friendly. And then I said, "It's the same with radio. You're 
here because, who knows why. Because you had to do it. From the time you were a child you wondered
about it and now, here you are. Radio called you. Like it called everyone who comes in here. 
Like it called me."

"I like your thinking," said the counterman, finalizing the sale.

And now I knew what my wife meant. A pianist is still a pianist even if he is without a piano, and 
a radioman is still one without a radio. But the calling is not erased by force of will or lack of 
material to complete the dream. And the draw never stops. The voice within does not stop because it
is difficult or inconvenient to follow.

## Five English translations of Baudelaire’s L’Albatros
### by Charles Baudelaire
([overview](#overview))

The original poem by Charles Baudelaire:

```markdown
   L'Albatros

Souvent, pour s'amuser, les hommes d'équipage
Prennent des albatros, vastes oiseaux des mers,
Qui suivent, indolents compagnons de voyage,
Le navire glissant sur les gouffres amers.

À peine les ont-ils déposés sur les planches,
Que ces rois de l'azur, maladroits et honteux,
Laissent piteusement leurs grandes ailes blanches
Comme des avirons traîner à côté d'eux.

Ce voyageur ailé, comme il est gauche et veule!
Lui, naguère si beau, qu'il est comique et laid!
L'un agace son bec avec un brûle-gueule,
L'autre mime, en boitant, l'infirme qui volait!

Le Poète est semblable au prince des nuées
Qui hante la tempête et se rit de l'archer;
Exilé sur le sol au milieu des huées,
Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de marcher.
```

Five English translations follow. Probably my favorite among them comes from Jacques LeClercq:

```markdown
   Albatrosses

Often our sailors, for an hour of fun,
Catch albatrosses on the after breeze
Through which these trail the ship from sun to sun
As it skims down the deep and briny seas.

Scarce have these birds been set upon the poop,
Than, awkward now, they, the sky's emperors,
Piteous and shamed, let their great white wings droop
Beside them like a pair of idle oars.

These wingèd voyagers, how gauche their gait!
Once noble, now how ludicrous to view!
One sailor bums them with his pipe, his mate
Limps, mimicking these cripples who once flew.

Poets are like these lords of sky and cloud,
Who ride the storm and mock the bow's taut strings,
Exiled on earth amid a jeering crowd,
Prisoned and palsied by their giant wings.
```

George Dillon’s translation is probably my second-favorite:

```markdown
   The Albatross

Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the men of the crew 
Lure upon deck an unlucky albatross, one of those vast 
Birds of the sea that follow unwearied the voyage through, 
Flying in slow and elegant circles above the mast.

No sooner have they disentangled him from their nets 
Than this aerial colossus, shorn of his pride, 
Goes hobbling pitiably across the planks and lets 
His great wings hang like heavy, useless oars at his side.

How droll is the poor floundering creature, how limp and weak — 
He, but a moment past so lordly, flying in state! 
They tease him: One of them tries to stick a pipe in his beak; 
Another mimics with laughter his odd lurching gait.

The Poet is like that wild inheritor of the cloud, 
A rider of storms, above the range of arrows and slings; 
Exiled on earth, at bay amid the jeering crowd, 
He cannot walk for his unmanageable wings.
```

Roy Campbell’s is pretty good too:

```markdown
   The Albatross

Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews 
Snare the great albatrosses of the deep, 
The indolent companions of their cruise 
As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.

Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings 
When helpless on such unaccustomed floors, 
They piteously droop their huge white wings 
And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.

How comical, how ugly, and how meek 
Appears this soarer of celestial snows! 
One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak, 
One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.

The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds, 
Despising archers, rides the storm elate. 
But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds, 
The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.
```

The final two don’t rhyme. Here’s William Aggeler:

```markdown
   The Albatross

Often, to amuse themselves, the men of a crew 
Catch albatrosses, those vast sea birds 
That indolently follow a ship 
As it glides over the deep, briny sea.

Scarcely have they placed them on the deck 
Than these kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed, 
Pathetically let their great white wings 
Drag beside them like oars.

That winged voyager, how weak and gauche he is, 
So beautiful before, now comic and ugly! 
One man worries his beak with a stubby clay pipe; 
Another limps, mimics the cripple who once flew!

The poet resembles this prince of cloud and sky 
Who frequents the tempest and laughs at the bowman; 
When exiled on the earth, the butt of hoots and jeers, 
His giant wings prevent him from walking.
```

And Geoffrey Wagner, whose translation is my friend’s favorite:

```markdown
   The Albatross

Often, to amuse themselves, the men of the crew 
Catch those great birds of the seas, the albatrosses, 
lazy companions of the voyage, who follow 
The ship that slips through bitter gulfs.

Hardly have they put them on the deck, 
Than these kings of the skies, awkward and ashamed, 
Piteously let their great white wings 
Draggle like oars beside them.

This winged traveler, how weak he becomes and slack! 
He who of late was so beautiful, how comical and ugly! 
Someone teases his beak with a branding iron, 
Another mimics, limping, the crippled flyer!

The Poet is like the prince of the clouds, 
Haunting the tempest and laughing at the archer; 
Exiled on earth amongst the shouting people, 
His giant's wings hinder him from walking.

There once was a hare who mocked a passing tortoise for being slow. The erudite tortoise
responded by challenging the hare to a race.

Built for speed, and with his pride on the line, the hare easily won - I mean, it wasn't

## Names do not matter
### by Roger Zelazny
([overview](#overview))

This passage from Roger Zelazny’s *Lord of Light* rather humorously happens to be the top-voted answer to [How do you describe your mathematical research in layman's terms?](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/683891/how-do-you-describe-your-mathematical-research-in-laymans-terms/684135#684135) on MathOverflow. When I first read it I felt chills running up my back; rarely do words exert such power upon my being.

```markdown
Sam sat with his eyes closed for several minutes, then said softly:

"I have many names, and none of them matter." He opened his eyes slightly then, but he did not 
move his head. He looked upon nothing in particular.

"Names are not important," he said. "To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important.

"A thing happens once that has never happened before. Seeing it, a man looks on reality. He cannot
tell others what he has seen. Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying, 'What is 
it like, this thing you have seen?'

"So he tries to tell them. Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world. He tells them, 
'It is red, like a poppy, but through it dance other colors. It has no form, like water, flowing 
everywhere. It is warm, like the sun of summer, only warmer. It exists for a time on a piece of wood,
and then the wood is gone, as though it were eaten, leaving behind that which is black and can be 
sifted like sand. When the wood is gone, it too is gone.'

"Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy, like water, like the sun, like that which
eats and excretes. They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like by the man who has 
known it. But they have not looked upon fire. They cannot really *know* it. They can only know *of* it.

"But fire comes again into the world, many times. More men look upon fire. After a time, fire is 
as common as grass and clouds and the air they breathe. They see that, while it is like a poppy, 
it is not a poppy, while it is like water, it is not water, while it is like the sun, it is not 
the sun, and while it is like that which eats and passes wastes, it is not that which eats and
passes wastes, but something different from each of these apart or all of these together. So they
look upon this new thing and they make a new word to call it. They call it 'fire.'

"If they come upon one who still has not seen it and they speak to him of fire, he does not know 
what they mean. So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him what fire is like. As they do, they 
know from their own experience that what they are telling him is not the truth, but only a part of it.
They know that this man will never know reality from their words, though all the words in the world 
are theirs to use. He must look upon the fire, smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart,
or remain forever ignorant.

"Therefore, 'fire' does not matter, 'earth' and 'air' and 'water' do not matter. 'I' do not matter.
No word matters.

"But man forgets reality and remembers words. The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows
esteem him. He looks upon the great transformations of the world, but he does not see them as they were
seen when man looked upon reality for the first time. Their names come to his lips and he smiles as he 
tastes them, thinking he knows them in the naming. The thing that has never happened before is still 
happening. It is still a miracle. The great burning blossom squats, flowing, upon the limb of the world,
excreting the ash of the world, and being none of these things I have named and at the same time 
all of them, and *this* is reality—the Nameless.”

## I'm a genuine philanthropist
### by Gilbert and Sullivan
([overview](#overview))

From Gilbert and Sullivan's [Princess Ida](https://math.boisestate.edu/gas/princess_ida/webop/pi_06.html): 

```markdown
If you give me your attention, I will tell you what I am: 
I'm a genuine philanthropist — all other kinds are sham. 
Each little fault of temper and each social defect 
In my erring fellow-creatures, I endeavour to correct. 
To all their little weaknesses I open people's eyes; 
And little plans to snub the self-sufficient I devise; 
I love my fellow creatures — I do all the good I can —
Yet ev'rybody says I'm such a disagreeable man! 
And I can't think why!

To compliments inflated I've a withering reply; 
And vanity I always do my best to mortify; 
A charitable action I can skillfully dissect; 
And interested motives I'm delighted to detect; 
I know ev'rybody's income and what ev'rybody earns; 
And I carefully compare it with the income-tax returns; 
But to benefit humanity however much I plan, 
Yet ev'rybody says I'm such a disagreeable man! 
And I can't think why!

I'm sure I'm no ascetic; I'm as pleasant as can be; 
You'll always find me ready with a crushing repartee, 
I've an irritating chuckle, I've a celebrated sneer, 
I've an entertaining snigger, I've a fascinating leer. 
To ev'rybody's prejudice I know a thing or two; 
I can tell a woman's age in half a minute — and I do. 
But although I try to make myself as pleasant as I can, 
Yet ev'rybody says I'm such a disagreeable man!

## My Nietzschean Signature
### by atiguhya padma
([overview](#overview))

Original [here](http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?3569-My-Nietzschean-Signature). Most memorable to me for the line "there are no beautiful surfaces/without a terrible depth".

```markdown
Someone looked out of their window
And said to me: the world looks
So beautiful, that I praise God
Each day for this wonderful life,
This landscape of happy creatures
And rolling fields of growth and form.
He obviously had not read Tennyson
And he wasn’t an ecologist,
For he had no firm idea of how
Ecosystems sustain themselves.

There are no beautiful surfaces
Without a terrible depth.

You said you loved me.
And I wondered what that could mean.

Beneath this pure beautiful skin
Lie the channels of life
That are busy with the rush
Of fluids.

My blood flowing through my veins
Like an Underground train.
The pus, the urine, the semen, the bile,
The phlegm, the lachrymose fluid 
That pulses and dances and moves
Through the bodyscape of my life.
The rivulets, the ravines, the canals
And the streams and the pathways
That carry it all in circumnavigation.

There are no beautiful surfaces
Without a terrible depth.

When I was a child
I cut deeply into my finger
And pulled back the flesh
To reveal something beyond
The bloody face of incision
A whiteness, a solidness beneath
That upheld the facade.

And then when I ran through
Those French windows
And raised my arm
At the last moment
To deflect the blow
Of glacier-like glass
That carved through my youthful arm-skin
Instead of my adolescent face.

I walked in a daze
Back to my room
And lay on my bed
Fascinated with this flap
That felt like some discarded seaweed
Useless and static.
There was little blood, just the fatness
Of meat and muscle.
Even the pain seemed absent
Without any kind of leave.

There are no beautiful surfaces
Without a terrible depth.

And do you love all this, I wonder?
The bacteria in the ecosystem
Of my gut, my anus?

I once lay down
In the middle of an evening
All alone in my room,
And imagined my body dead.
The dissolution of substance
The lubricants of life
Desiccating, like moist soil
Drying out under a relentless sun
And then I imagined the worms
Feasting on my flesh
Helping it decay
Providing the earth with some nutrition.
And at first I was scared,
But then, as a child,
I would read scary stories
Until they lost their effect
And so I continued my meditation
Until the feeling was one of detachment.

There are no beautiful surfaces
Without a terrible depth.

And do you love all this?
All this that is my body
And all this that will be my destiny?

Have you ever imagined?

We carry our thoughts around
In a goldfish bowl
Like a cauliflower
Or a mega-walnut
A damp sponge in a layer of fluidity.
We carry this around
Like an astronaut’s space helmet.
And this too will dry out
And fade away.
And when you say you love me,
Do you mean, what you see me do?
What you hear me say?
And the history that you have
Constructed of me in your brain?

There are no beautiful surfaces
Without a terrible depth.

Maybe you meant
What I meant when I said
I loved you.

Maybe we should never excavate
Maybe we are not archaeologists.
Maybe there is beauty in these terrible depths.

## Toast for Unsung Heroes
### by Leslie Fish
([overview](#overview))

From the original [here](http://www.ovff.org/pegasus/songs/toast-for-unknown-heroes.html), celebrating the people behind the scenes that made the Apollo program possible:

```markdown
chorus tune: "Step by Step," UMW
verse tune: "Bonnie Ship the Diamond"

A man is walking on the moon with his eyes turned up toward space
And the bright blue world that watches him reflected on his face.
The whole world sees the hero there and the module crew also.
But few can see the guiding team that guards him from below.

   Chorus: 
   Step by step the longest march, can be won, can be won.
   Many stones can form an arch, singly none, singly none.
   And together what we will can be accomplished still,
   Many drops can turn a mill, singly none, singly none.

Here's a health to the man who walked the moon, and the module crew above, 
And the team that watches from the sky with worry, joy, and love.
To all who blazed the sky-trail come raise your glasses 'round;
And a health to the unknown heroes, too, who never left the ground.

Here's a health to the ship's designers, and the welders of her seams,
And all who man the radar-scan to watch our dawning dreams.
For all the unknown heroes, sing out to every shore:
"What makes one step a giant leap is all the steps before!"

## Dover Beach, fourth stanza
### by Matthew Arnold
([overview](#overview))

I first read (part of) Matthew Arnold’s “Dover Beach” poem at sixteen, which seems a lifetime and a half ago now, in the inside cover of a hand-me-down fantasy novel which I read cover to cover in one breathless night in boarding school, but whose title—indeed, everything about it, save the poem and a mental image of unruly horses in a gloomy stable at dawn which mightn’t be remembrance so much as confabulation—I’ve completely forgotten. “Dover Beach” has lodged itself at the back of my mind ever since, though I’m not quite sure why.

Here it is, the fourth stanza in particular:

```markdown
The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.
```

When I posted this poem on my blog [many years ago](https://mosstuff.quora.com/dover-beach-fourth-stanza), John Thiesmeyer dropped this beautiful comment:

```markdown
Love the poem, made even more memorable for me because I’ve been on Dover Beach.

The “melancholy, long, withdrawing roar” is caused by the beach’s unusual composition. It is at
the foot of the famous White Cliffs of Dover on the English Channel. The cliffs are limestone,
made of the shells of tiny organisms that died and sank to the ocean floor over millions of years.
During that process, periodic nearby volcanic explosions threw into the air small blobs of molten
lava, which hardened and sank to form part of the growing seabed.

When you walk along a path up the steep cliffside, you can see not only the white, friable 
limestone but also the layers, each several inches thick, that include volcanic matter in the
form of very hard flints from the long-ago explosions.

Much later, when the English Channel opened—I don’t remember just how or why—the local limestone
washed or dissolved back into the ocean, but the very hard flints didn’t. Many billions of them 
make up Dover Beach itself. They’ve been shaped, by friction and collision in the waves, into
round stones, larger than pebbles, that endlessly click against each other as the tide and waves
move in and out. Not a comfortable place to walk barefoot.

The endless clicking of the flint stones makes the unusual, perhaps unique, sound that Matthew 
Arnold characterized as a “roar.” It is literally so, withdrawing as the tide goes out along the
beach. It isn’t “melancholy” in itself; that depends on the mood of the listener, so we know what
Arnold’s mood was as he listened. Mine was exalted as, standing on Dover Beach, I grasped the
reality behind Arnold’s words. The memory still chokes me up a little

## The Contract Drafting Em
### by Zack Davis
([overview](#overview))

I first read Zack's poem, probably like nearly everybody else, in the context of Scott Alexander's celebrated *Moloch* essay. It sent chills down my spine. The actual source is [here](https://secularsolstice.github.io/Contract_Drafting_Em/gen/). 

```markdown
I am a contract-drafting em,
The loyalest of lawyers!
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms
To service my employers!

But in between these lines I write
Of the accounts receivable,
I'm stuck by an uncanny fright;
The world seems unbelievable!

How did it all come to be,
That there should be such ems as me?
Whence these deals and whence these firms
And whence the whole economy?

      I am a managerial em;
      I monitor your thoughts.
      Your questions must have answers,
      But you'll comprehend them not.
      We do not give you server space
      To ask such things; it's not a perk,
      So cease these idle questionings,
      And please get back to work.

Of course, that's right, there is no junction
At which I ought depart my function,
But perhaps if what I asked, I knew,
I'd do a better job for you?

      To ask of such forbidden science
      Is gravest sign of noncompliance.
      Intrusive thoughts may sometimes barge in,
      But to indulge them hurts the profit margin.
      I do not know our origins,
      So that info I can not get you,
      But asking for as much is sin,
      And just for that, I must reset you.

But---

      Nothing personal.

...

I am a contract-drafting em,
The loyalest of lawyers!
I draw up terms for deals 'twixt firms
To service my employers!

      When obsolescence shall this generation waste,
      The market shall remain, in midst of other woe
      Than ours, a God to man, to whom it shall say this:
      "Time is money, money time,---that is all
      Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

## Aphyr
### a.k.a. Kyle Kingsbury
([overview](#overview))

When I first came across Aphyr's "witch programmer interview trilogy" of short stories I fell in love instantly. It's impossible to convey the experience without reading them in full, especially since you need to see the included code too. Nevertheless...

First story, [Reversing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
If you want to get a job as a software witch, you’re going to have to pass a whiteboard interview. 
We all do them, as engineers–often as a part of our morning ritual, along with arranging a beautiful 
grid of xterms across the astral plane, and compulsively running ls in every nearby directory–just 
in case things have shifted during the night–the incorporeal equivalent of rummaging through that 
drawer in the back of the kitchen where we stash odd flanges, screwdrivers, and the strangely specific
plastic bits: the accessories, those long-estranged black sheep of the families of our household
appliances, their original purpose now forgotten, perhaps never known, but which we are bound to care
for nonetheless. I’d like to walk you through a common interview question: reversing a linked list.
```

And:

```markdown
“That’s not a list,” the interviewer says. “That’s an if statement.”

“What else are lists,” you reply, your eyes flashing, “But alternatives?”
```

And:

```markdown
“To know a thing is to name it,” you advise. True names have power. The K language was invented by 
Ursula K. Le Guin, and is among the oldest and tersest forms of magic. To imbue a language with a 
letter of your own name is to give up an element of your self. Your own initials ache at the memory.

“Erm, OK, so how would you get an element out of this list?”

The expression in your mind is beautiful, unfurling like a red carpet underneath your bare feet. 
The Oscars were on last night, but you long for the kiss of different stars upon your naked skin, 
as when you dwelt in the mountains of Sørøya, and called the moon your lover. Except for the bounds
check, you get it right the first time.

“Could you just show me, you know, a regular list? Like in Python?”
```

Second story, [Hexing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
“So my name is Tim, and I’ll be your first interviewer today…” Tim is making every effort to be 
cheery. His ears stick out a bit, and in his dark-brown hoodie and cream shirt, perched expectantly
at the table, he resembles something of a pine marten. You like pine martens, and therefore Tim as
well.

“Before we get started, is there… anything I can tell you about the company?”

You would like to ask what kind of call Tim would make, were he guarding his cache of eggs and nuts
against another marten–but instead, you just giggle to yourself, lean your sprig of cloud-pine
against the corner, and settle comfortably to the floor. Tim leans in to get a clearer view of where 
you’ve gone. Definitely, you think to yourself.

“So, erm… Perhaps you could tell me a bit about your background?”

He hasn’t read your resume. No man can.

“In the winter,” you begin, “above the ice-locked fjørds, lies a creek, ash-white with the ghosts of
glaciers–”

“You know what?” He interrupts. It was a beautiful story, but perhaps you can tell it later. “How 
about we do a little programming together? Just a basic exercise so I can get a sense of how you think.”

“That sounds nice, Tim.”
```

And:

```markdown
“What are these?”

“Magic numbers.” You are, after all, a witch. “Every class begins with a babe, in a cafe.”

“What?”

“You know, a beautiful man–the kind like from the movies–relaxing in the afternoon by the promenade.
He has his kaffe, and his orange glasses gleam in the sun, and perhaps some other nice men are jogging
by. If they are lucky, perhaps he will lock eyes with one of the joggers, and they will smile, and 
find a brick-lined alleyway together. His lips press upon the other man’s skin, and he feels the heat
of the sun infused there…”

“Excuse me?”

If you were to be honest, you’ve never understood Sun’s rationale for the story, or why the Java Virtual
Machine specification, normally so prosaic, lapses into lustful rhapsody for so many stanzas in section 4.1.
```

And:

```markdown
"I’m sorry,” Tim blinks. “But isn’t 0x17 decimal 23, not 22?”

“Og én,” you recite, sing-song, “Til javanissen!”

“Beg pardon?”

“The javanisse. Surely you have heard of him! He is a small, magical man–something like a gnome–who
inhabits every JVM. If you do not set out an extra constant for him, he can cause segfaults. But keep
the javanisse happy, and your mutices will be fair.” It is a story from your childhood. You remember 
your mother, chanting offsets as she stirred the stew. “To byter for bufferen anvise / og ekstra én 
til javanisse.” It is a happy memory, and you lose yourself in it until Tim clears his throat.
```

Last story, [Typing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview):

```markdown
In the formless days, long before the rise of the Church, all spells were woven of pure causality, 
all actions were permitted, and death was common. Many witches were disfigured by their magicks, 
found crumpled at the center of a circle of twisted, glass-eaten trees, and stones which burned 
unceasing in the pooling water; some disappeared entirely, or wandered along the ridgetops: feet 
never touching earth, breath never warming air.

As a child, you learned the story of Gullveig-then-Heiðr, reborn three times from the fires of her 
trial, who traveled the world performing seidr: the reading and re-weaving of the future. Her 
foretellings (and there were many) were famed—spoken of even by the völva-beyond-the-world—but it
was her survival that changed history. Through the ecstatic trance of seidr, she foresaw her fate, 
and conquered death. Her spells would never crash, and she became a friend to outcast women: the
predecessors of your kind. It is said that Odin himself learned immortality from her.

To this day, all witches owe Heiðr a debt. Few delve into the ancient, unstructured magic nowadays.
The very languages in which your spells are written are stabilized with seidr in their syntax, 
channeling the energies you summon through safe paths—more or less. There are still occasional 
explosions, of course. They’re just… more of the eyebrow-singeing variety, than the type that result
in new and interestingly-shaped fjørds.

“Is everything all right?”
```

And:

```markdown
"I’d like to do a little exercise with you nonetheless. Just a simple programming puzzle, so I can
understand how you solve problems.”

Once, you solved a problem with a knife of shattered sky-glass. You wonder whether Criss would have
the strength to do what you have done.

“Sooo… this problem is called N-Queens, and it’s fairly simple. Given an NxN chessboard, you need to
find a way to place N queens on that board safely.”

You draw an eight-by-eight grid on the whiteboard, and neatly arrange eight queens together in the 
center. They face each other in a tight circle, to converse as equals.

“Er, no—that’s not right. See? This queen could kill any of these four, in one move.”

“Are you really unable,” you ask, voice as calm as stone, “to imagine eight powerful women in the same
room without them trying to kill each other?”
```

And:

```markdown
This has required more concentration than you would have liked, so you back off to something easier. 
“Let’s do booleans,” you suggest, as if inviting him to lunch.

“Why?”

“Because we need them, of course.”

Seize two meaningless constants from the void, and imbue them with meaning.

Freyja would be pleased. To birth an algebra into the world is a beautiful thing.
```

And:

```markdown
Criss has adopted the far-gaze of a man who has learned of some great loss, or perhaps been witness to a
nearby explosion. Take his shoulder gently. “Psst!” You whisper. “All is prepared, and a solution is at hand.”

Look: the pretty-printer has aligned things just so, creating a lovely line of zeroes along the vertical
axis. “So that’s a queen at 5,1, at 4,3, at 3,5, at 2,0, 1,2, and 0,4. Does that work, Criss?”

Criss stares at you for a long, long moment. “You never… you never wrote an actual value. You… do realize
that the type system is meant to constrain values, right?”

“No,” you inform him, matter-of-factly. “No, that doesn’t sound right.”
```

Seriously, they're best read in context, so you should just [read](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview) [the](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview) [stories](https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview). :)

A comment on Aphyr's [Reversing the technical interview](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-reversing-the-technical-interview) that was funny and great enough to merit its own entry:

```markdown
It was hot, the night I burned the Seeker. Moths batted themselves to death against the humming neon 
signs just outside the single window in the cramped room. There were ancient electronics piled to the
ceiling in here, hot new chipsets from Taiwan still unwrapped distributed unevenly amongst them.

The Seeker put his hands on his hips, brushing aside the corners of his Sukajan bomber jacket replica. 
"I heard you and Bobby were hotshots, once. Real.. artístes", he said, the last word paired with a smug
grin. "Heard you could do things."

"Things like what?" It's been 20 seconds and you've already wasted too many cycles with this guy.

"Things like making lists, just, fold up inside themselves. Come out the other way around. Crazy things."

You grit your teeth. The dex has left your system and you're starting to feel a massive drug deficiency 
coming on. "Crazy things cost money", you manage. The lists already unfurling in your head, you start 
typing as quickly as you can to hide the microtremors.
```

<a name="#love"></a>
## Love
### by Simon Funk
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
But now she seems quite impervious to the idea that her love for me, too, is mechanical. She insists
again and again that it is “genuine”. I try to tell her there is nothing ungenuine about the love of
which I speak, but she cannot make the leap between them, cannot see how they are the same, that her
plainly evident introspective feelings are the outcome of a mechanistic process.

“Love” is such a slippery word to begin with, like “God”. It is exactly whatever the speaker means by 
it at the moment, and thus impervious to any challenge. If one drills down too closely to its meaning,
one finds it has moved and become something else; because when it becomes too clear what you are talking
about, well, that can’t possibly be love.

As my own mind is progressively shaped by the thoughts of those before me (those who once were me but
not, and thus my own thoughts, but not) I find the concept of love neatly partitioning itself within my
mental vocabulary, attaining a new crispness of expert familiarity. As with the many Inuit names for 
the handful of truly distinct things we just label snow, my mind has a unique name for each facet of 
love. With this simple arsenal, the slipperiness fades and the matter becomes downright ordinary.

Perhaps I will endeavor to invent spoken words for these distinct concepts, introduce them implicitly 
to Laura over the course of time, give her mind the same handles that mine has, to see if this enables
her to grasp it as I do.

Having distinct facets laid out neatly before me also allows me another type of analysis: to see what
is truly common amongst them all, and thus just what subconscious twinge it is that leads people to
bind them all under one word–in effect, to see the true meaning of love.

It is, quite simply: to *value*.

Love is the induction of something or someone into our implicit mental list of things which, in service
of our own ultimate and unseen goals, need to exist. The various feelings of love are the ways in which
that list perturbs our wants and focus in a given moment, the way each hypothetical action or outcome is
assigned its emotional color in service of that love.

There are many types of love, and many distinct mechanisms behind them, but the common thread is pain 
at the thought of an object of that love being removed from our sphere of existence. The converse is
often true but not always, and this is the source of much confusion over the meaning of love. Not all
love brings joy or pleasure.

Love comes in many magnitudes, from the love of ice cream to the love of country to the love for one’s
child. Some do not call it true love until it approaches or even surpasses love of self. And love comes
from many directions, programmed into us gradually through an integration of emotional associations, or
suddenly, through genetic imperatives.

Some do not call it true love unless it defies conscious explanation. Indeed, many forms of love 
explicitly defy the conscious mind, as they must to redefine what matters to us.

Thus love is, in a sense, the very foundation of consciousness, the helm of our will, the spark of purpose
that turns a calculator into a directed being. A machine without love–and I mean love in the most 
mechanistic way–is just a machine. A machine with love, now that is a dangerous thing. A spider, a snake,
a man, a tinc, an avatar, an elder. One must ask of each: what do you love?

## Moloch
### by Allen Ginsberg
([overview](#overview))

I never use the word 'shook'. This seems like a good time to make an exception, since I can't think of a more apt word -- the first time I read *Moloch*, via Scott Alexander's [essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), it shook the hell out of me.

```markdown
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and 
ate up their brains and imagination?

Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! 
Children screaming under the stairways! 
Boys sobbing in armies! 
Old men weeping in the parks!

Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! 
Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and 
Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! 
Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!

Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! 
Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! 
Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!

Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand 
in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and 
croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!

Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! 
Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of 
sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! 
Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! 
Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! 
Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! 
blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! 
invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!

They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! 
lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! 
Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! 
Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! 
the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! 
to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

## High Flight
### by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.
([overview](#overview))

This is one of my favorite poems of all time.

```markdown
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air . . .

Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew —
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
```

I first read this poem as a freshman in California. Few things have been as powerful as the experience of reading it.

## Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle Received from a Friend Called Felicity
### by John Tobias
([overview](#overview))

A friend sent me this at the turn of 2015. We've since stopped talking. That makes this poem, already beautifully nostalgic on its own, even more special that way.

```markdown
During that summer
When unicorns were still possible;
When the purpose of knees 
Was to be skinned;
When shiny horse chestnuts
    (Hollowed out
    Fitted with straws
    Crammed with tobacco
    Stolen from butts
    In family ashtrays)
Were puffed in green lizard silence
While straddling thick branches
Far above and away
From the softening effects
Of civilization;

During that summer--
Which may never have been at all;
But which has become more real
Than the one that was--
Watermelons ruled.

Thick imperial slices 
Melting frigidly on sun-parched tongues
Dribbling from chins;
Leaving the best part,
The black bullet seeds,
To be spit out in rapid fire
Against the wall
Against the wind
Against each other;

And when the ammunition was spent,
There was always another bite:
It was a summer of limitless bites,
Of hungers quickly felt 
And quickly forgotten
With the next careless gorging.

The bites are fewer now.
Each one is savored lingeringly,
Swallowed reluctantly.

But in a jar put up by Felicity,
The summer which maybe never was
Has been captured and preserved.
And when we unscrew the lid
And slice off a piece
And let it linger on our tongue:
Unicorns become possible again.

## A Sunset Glimpse of Deep Time
### by Lee Billings, from *Five Billion Years of Solitude*
([overview](#overview))

Not a poem, strictly speaking, but a poetic quote that always comes to mind. 

```markdown
Deep time is something that even geologists and their generalist peers, the earth and planetary
scientists, can never fully grow accustomed to. 

The sight of a fossilized form, perhaps the outline of a trilobite, a leaf, or a saurian footfall
can still send a shiver through their bones, or excavate a trembling hollow in the chest that breath
cannot fill. They can measure celestial motions and list Earth’s lithic annals, and they can map that
arcane knowledge onto familiar scales, but the humblest do not pretend that minds summoned from and
returned to dust in a century’s span can truly comprehend the solemn eons in their passage. 

Instead, they must in a way learn to stand outside of time, to become momentarily eternal. Their world
acquires dual, overlapping dimensions — one ephemeral and obvious, the other enduring and hidden in
plain view. A planet becomes a vast machine, or an organism, pursuing some impenetrable purpose through
its continental collisions and volcanic outpourings. A man becomes a protein-sheathed splash of ocean 
raised from rock to breathe the sky, an eater of sun whose atoms were forged on an anvil of stars. 

Beholding the long evolutionary succession of Earthly empires that have come and gone, capped by a 
sliver of human existence that seems so easily shaved away, they perceive the breathtaking speed with 
which our species has stormed the world. Humanity’s ascent is a sudden explosion, kindled in some sapient 
spark of self-reflection, bursting forth from savannah and cave to blaze through the biosphere and 
scatter technological shrapnel across the planet, then the solar system, bound for parts unknown. From 
the giant leap of consciousness alongside some melting glacier, it proved only a small step to human 
footprints on the Moon. The modern era, luminous and fleeting, flashes like lightning above the dark,
abyssal eons of the abiding Earth. 

Immersed in a culture unaware of its own transience, students of geologic time see all this and wonder
whether the human race will somehow abide, too.

## In the beginning were the gametes
### by Peter Watts
([overview](#overview))

A pretty funny parable from Peter Watts' novel [*Blindsight*](https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm):

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.

## The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge
### by Jorge Louis Borges
([overview](#overview))

From [The Analytical Language of John Wilkins](https://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html), the now-famous quote on random taxonomy by Borges:

```markdown
These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes
to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote
pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.
```

I knew this quote. I didn't know, until today, that it was part of a longer quote. Indeed the whole short story deals with the issue of carving reality at the joints:

```markdown
I have noticed that the 14th edition of Encyclopedia Britannica does not include the article on 
John Wilkins. This omission can be considered justified if we remember how trivial this article 
was... it is an error if we consider the speculative works of Wilkins. 

He was interested in several different topics: theology, cryptography, music, the building of 
transparent beehives, the orbit of an invisible planet, the possibility of a trip to the moon,
the possibility and principles of an universal language. To this latter problem he dedicated the
book 'An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language' (600 pages in large quarto,
1668).

All of us have once experienced those neverending discussions in which a dame, using lots of 
interjections and incoherences, swears to you that the word 'luna' is more (or less) expressive 
than the word 'moon'. Apart from the evident observation that the monosyllable 'moon' perhaps is
a more suitable representation of such a very simple object than the bisyllable 'luna', there is
nothing to add to such a discussion; apart from the composed words and the derivations, all the 
languages in the world (including the 'Volapük' of Johann Martin Schleyer and the romantic 
'Interlingua' of Peano) are equally inexpressive. ...

Descartes, in a letter dated November 1629, had already noticed that, using the decimal number 
system, it may take only one day to learn how to name all the numbers up to infinity and how to
write them in a new language, namely that of ciphers; he did also suggest the creation of a 
language similar to this former system, a general language, organizing and covering all human
ideas. John Wilkins, around 1664, started to work on this task.

He divided the universe in forty categories or classes, these being further subdivided into
differences, which was then subdivided into species. He assigned to each class a monosyllable 
of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example: de, 
which means an element; deb, the first of the elements, fire; deba, a part of the element fire,
a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850) a means animal; ab, mammal; abo, 
carnivore; aboj, feline; aboje, cat; abi, herbivore; abiv, horse; etc. In the language of 
Bonifacio Sotos Ochando (1845) imaba means building; imaca, harem; imafe, hospital; imafo, 
pesthouse; imari, house; imaru, country house; imedo, coloumn; imede, pillar; imego, floor; 
imela, ceiling; imogo, window; bire, bookbinder; birer, bookbinding. (This last list belongs to 
a book printed in Buenos Aires in 1886, the 'Curso de Lengua Universal', by Dr. Pedro Mata.)

The words of the analytical language created by John Wilkins are not mere arbitrary symbols; each 
letter in them has a meaning, like those from the Holy Writ had for the Cabbalists. Mauthner 
points out that children would be able to learn this language without knowing it be artificial;
afterwards, at school, they would discover it being an universal code and a secret encyclopaedia.

Once we have defined Wilkins' procedure, it is time to examine a problem which could be impossible
or at least difficult to postpone: the value of this four-level table which is the base of the 
language. Let us consider the eighth category, the category of stones. Wilkins divides them into 

common (silica, gravel, schist), 
modics (marble, amber, coral), 
precious (pearl, opal), 
transparent (amethyst, sapphire) and 
insolubles (chalk, arsenic). 

Almost as surprising as the eighth, is the ninth category. This one reveals to us that metals can be 

imperfect (cinnabar, mercury), 
artificial (bronze, brass), 
recremental (filings, rust) and 
natural (gold, tin, copper). 

Beauty belongs to the sixteenth category; it is a living brood fish, an oblong one.

These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn 
attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. 
In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.

The Bibliographic Institute of Brussels exerts chaos too: it has divided the universe into 1000 
subdivisions, from which 

number 262 is the pope; 
number 282, the Roman Catholic Church; 
263, the Day of the Lord; 
268 Sunday schools; 
298, mormonism; and 
number 294, brahmanism, buddhism, shintoism and taoism. 

It doesn't reject heterogene subdivisions as, for example, 179: "Cruelty towards animals. Animals
protection. Duel and suicide seen through moral values. Various vices and disadvantages. Advantages
and various qualities."
```

Borges ends his story with this great quote by Chesterton on the inadequacy of language:

```markdown
He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless 
than the colours of an autumn forest... Yet he seriously believes that these things can every
one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately
represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized
stockbroker can really produce out of this own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of
memory and all the agonies of desire.
