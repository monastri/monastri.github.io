## Love
### by Simon Funk
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
But now she seems quite impervious to the idea that her love for me, too, is mechanical. She insists
again and again that it is “genuine”. I try to tell her there is nothing ungenuine about the love of
which I speak, but she cannot make the leap between them, cannot see how they are the same, that her
plainly evident introspective feelings are the outcome of a mechanistic process.

“Love” is such a slippery word to begin with, like “God”. It is exactly whatever the speaker means by 
it at the moment, and thus impervious to any challenge. If one drills down too closely to its meaning,
one finds it has moved and become something else; because when it becomes too clear what you are talking
about, well, that can’t possibly be love.

As my own mind is progressively shaped by the thoughts of those before me (those who once were me but
not, and thus my own thoughts, but not) I find the concept of love neatly partitioning itself within my
mental vocabulary, attaining a new crispness of expert familiarity. As with the many Inuit names for 
the handful of truly distinct things we just label snow, my mind has a unique name for each facet of 
love. With this simple arsenal, the slipperiness fades and the matter becomes downright ordinary.

Perhaps I will endeavor to invent spoken words for these distinct concepts, introduce them implicitly 
to Laura over the course of time, give her mind the same handles that mine has, to see if this enables
her to grasp it as I do.

Having distinct facets laid out neatly before me also allows me another type of analysis: to see what
is truly common amongst them all, and thus just what subconscious twinge it is that leads people to
bind them all under one word–in effect, to see the true meaning of love.

It is, quite simply: to *value*.

Love is the induction of something or someone into our implicit mental list of things which, in service
of our own ultimate and unseen goals, need to exist. The various feelings of love are the ways in which
that list perturbs our wants and focus in a given moment, the way each hypothetical action or outcome is
assigned its emotional color in service of that love.

There are many types of love, and many distinct mechanisms behind them, but the common thread is pain 
at the thought of an object of that love being removed from our sphere of existence. The converse is
often true but not always, and this is the source of much confusion over the meaning of love. Not all
love brings joy or pleasure.

Love comes in many magnitudes, from the love of ice cream to the love of country to the love for one’s
child. Some do not call it true love until it approaches or even surpasses love of self. And love comes
from many directions, programmed into us gradually through an integration of emotional associations, or
suddenly, through genetic imperatives.

Some do not call it true love unless it defies conscious explanation. Indeed, many forms of love 
explicitly defy the conscious mind, as they must to redefine what matters to us.

Thus love is, in a sense, the very foundation of consciousness, the helm of our will, the spark of purpose
that turns a calculator into a directed being. A machine without love–and I mean love in the most 
mechanistic way–is just a machine. A machine with love, now that is a dangerous thing. A spider, a snake,
a man, a tinc, an avatar, an elder. One must ask of each: what do you love?

## Moloch
### by Allen Ginsberg
([overview](#overview))

I never use the word 'shook'. This seems like a good time to make an exception, since I can't think of a more apt word -- the first time I read *Moloch*, via Scott Alexander's [essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), it shook the hell out of me.

```markdown
What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and 
ate up their brains and imagination?

Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! 
Children screaming under the stairways! 
Boys sobbing in armies! 
Old men weeping in the parks!

Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! 
Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!

Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and 
Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! 
Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!

Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! 
Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! 
Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!

Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand 
in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and 
croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!

Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! 
Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of 
sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! 
Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! 
Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! 
Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!

Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! 
blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! 
invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!

They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! 
lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!

Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!

Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!

Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! 
Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! 
Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!

Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! 
the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! 
to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

## High Flight
### by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.
([overview](#overview))

This is one of my favorite poems of all time.

```markdown
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds, — and done a hundred things
You have not dreamed of — wheeled and soared and swung
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung
My eager craft through footless halls of air . . .

Up, up the long, delirious burning blue
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew —
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
```

I first read this poem as a freshman in California. Few things have been as powerful as the experience of reading it.

## Reflections on a Gift of Watermelon Pickle Received from a Friend Called Felicity
### by John Tobias
([overview](#overview))

A friend sent me this at the turn of 2015. We've since stopped talking. That makes this poem, already beautifully nostalgic on its own, even more special that way.

```markdown
During that summer
When unicorns were still possible;
When the purpose of knees 
Was to be skinned;
When shiny horse chestnuts
    (Hollowed out
    Fitted with straws
    Crammed with tobacco
    Stolen from butts
    In family ashtrays)
Were puffed in green lizard silence
While straddling thick branches
Far above and away
From the softening effects
Of civilization;

During that summer--
Which may never have been at all;
But which has become more real
Than the one that was--
Watermelons ruled.

Thick imperial slices 
Melting frigidly on sun-parched tongues
Dribbling from chins;
Leaving the best part,
The black bullet seeds,
To be spit out in rapid fire
Against the wall
Against the wind
Against each other;

And when the ammunition was spent,
There was always another bite:
It was a summer of limitless bites,
Of hungers quickly felt 
And quickly forgotten
With the next careless gorging.

The bites are fewer now.
Each one is savored lingeringly,
Swallowed reluctantly.

But in a jar put up by Felicity,
The summer which maybe never was
Has been captured and preserved.
And when we unscrew the lid
And slice off a piece
And let it linger on our tongue:
Unicorns become possible again.

## A Sunset Glimpse of Deep Time
### by Lee Billings, from *Five Billion Years of Solitude*
([overview](#overview))

Not a poem, strictly speaking, but a poetic quote that always comes to mind. 

```markdown
Deep time is something that even geologists and their generalist peers, the earth and planetary
scientists, can never fully grow accustomed to. 

The sight of a fossilized form, perhaps the outline of a trilobite, a leaf, or a saurian footfall
can still send a shiver through their bones, or excavate a trembling hollow in the chest that breath
cannot fill. They can measure celestial motions and list Earth’s lithic annals, and they can map that
arcane knowledge onto familiar scales, but the humblest do not pretend that minds summoned from and
returned to dust in a century’s span can truly comprehend the solemn eons in their passage. 

Instead, they must in a way learn to stand outside of time, to become momentarily eternal. Their world
acquires dual, overlapping dimensions — one ephemeral and obvious, the other enduring and hidden in
plain view. A planet becomes a vast machine, or an organism, pursuing some impenetrable purpose through
its continental collisions and volcanic outpourings. A man becomes a protein-sheathed splash of ocean 
raised from rock to breathe the sky, an eater of sun whose atoms were forged on an anvil of stars. 

Beholding the long evolutionary succession of Earthly empires that have come and gone, capped by a 
sliver of human existence that seems so easily shaved away, they perceive the breathtaking speed with 
which our species has stormed the world. Humanity’s ascent is a sudden explosion, kindled in some sapient 
spark of self-reflection, bursting forth from savannah and cave to blaze through the biosphere and 
scatter technological shrapnel across the planet, then the solar system, bound for parts unknown. From 
the giant leap of consciousness alongside some melting glacier, it proved only a small step to human 
footprints on the Moon. The modern era, luminous and fleeting, flashes like lightning above the dark,
abyssal eons of the abiding Earth. 

Immersed in a culture unaware of its own transience, students of geologic time see all this and wonder
whether the human race will somehow abide, too.

## In the beginning were the gametes
### by Peter Watts
([overview](#overview))

A pretty funny parable from Peter Watts' novel [*Blindsight*](https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm):

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.

## The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge
### by Jorge Louis Borges
([overview](#overview))

From [The Analytical Language of John Wilkins](https://www.alamut.com/subj/artiface/language/johnWilkins.html), the now-famous quote on random taxonomy by Borges:

```markdown
These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes
to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote
pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.
```

I knew this quote. I didn't know, until today, that it was part of a longer quote. Indeed the whole short story deals with the issue of carving reality at the joints:

```markdown
I have noticed that the 14th edition of Encyclopedia Britannica does not include the article on 
John Wilkins. This omission can be considered justified if we remember how trivial this article 
was... it is an error if we consider the speculative works of Wilkins. 

He was interested in several different topics: theology, cryptography, music, the building of 
transparent beehives, the orbit of an invisible planet, the possibility of a trip to the moon,
the possibility and principles of an universal language. To this latter problem he dedicated the
book 'An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language' (600 pages in large quarto,
1668).

All of us have once experienced those neverending discussions in which a dame, using lots of 
interjections and incoherences, swears to you that the word 'luna' is more (or less) expressive 
than the word 'moon'. Apart from the evident observation that the monosyllable 'moon' perhaps is
a more suitable representation of such a very simple object than the bisyllable 'luna', there is
nothing to add to such a discussion; apart from the composed words and the derivations, all the 
languages in the world (including the 'Volapük' of Johann Martin Schleyer and the romantic 
'Interlingua' of Peano) are equally inexpressive. ...

Descartes, in a letter dated November 1629, had already noticed that, using the decimal number 
system, it may take only one day to learn how to name all the numbers up to infinity and how to
write them in a new language, namely that of ciphers; he did also suggest the creation of a 
language similar to this former system, a general language, organizing and covering all human
ideas. John Wilkins, around 1664, started to work on this task.

He divided the universe in forty categories or classes, these being further subdivided into
differences, which was then subdivided into species. He assigned to each class a monosyllable 
of two letters; to each difference, a consonant; to each species, a vowel. For example: de, 
which means an element; deb, the first of the elements, fire; deba, a part of the element fire,
a flame. In a similar language invented by Letellier (1850) a means animal; ab, mammal; abo, 
carnivore; aboj, feline; aboje, cat; abi, herbivore; abiv, horse; etc. In the language of 
Bonifacio Sotos Ochando (1845) imaba means building; imaca, harem; imafe, hospital; imafo, 
pesthouse; imari, house; imaru, country house; imedo, coloumn; imede, pillar; imego, floor; 
imela, ceiling; imogo, window; bire, bookbinder; birer, bookbinding. (This last list belongs to 
a book printed in Buenos Aires in 1886, the 'Curso de Lengua Universal', by Dr. Pedro Mata.)

The words of the analytical language created by John Wilkins are not mere arbitrary symbols; each 
letter in them has a meaning, like those from the Holy Writ had for the Cabbalists. Mauthner 
points out that children would be able to learn this language without knowing it be artificial;
afterwards, at school, they would discover it being an universal code and a secret encyclopaedia.

Once we have defined Wilkins' procedure, it is time to examine a problem which could be impossible
or at least difficult to postpone: the value of this four-level table which is the base of the 
language. Let us consider the eighth category, the category of stones. Wilkins divides them into 

common (silica, gravel, schist), 
modics (marble, amber, coral), 
precious (pearl, opal), 
transparent (amethyst, sapphire) and 
insolubles (chalk, arsenic). 

Almost as surprising as the eighth, is the ninth category. This one reveals to us that metals can be 

imperfect (cinnabar, mercury), 
artificial (bronze, brass), 
recremental (filings, rust) and 
natural (gold, tin, copper). 

Beauty belongs to the sixteenth category; it is a living brood fish, an oblong one.

These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn 
attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. 
In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: 

(a) belonging to the emperor, 
(b) embalmed, 
(c) tame, 
(d) sucking pigs, 
(e) sirens, 
(f) fabulous,
(g) stray dogs, 
(h) included in the present classification, 
(i) frenzied, 
(j) innumerable,
(k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, 
(l) et cetera,
(m) having just broken the water pitcher, 
(n) that from a long way off look like flies.

The Bibliographic Institute of Brussels exerts chaos too: it has divided the universe into 1000 
subdivisions, from which 

number 262 is the pope; 
number 282, the Roman Catholic Church; 
263, the Day of the Lord; 
268 Sunday schools; 
298, mormonism; and 
number 294, brahmanism, buddhism, shintoism and taoism. 

It doesn't reject heterogene subdivisions as, for example, 179: "Cruelty towards animals. Animals
protection. Duel and suicide seen through moral values. Various vices and disadvantages. Advantages
and various qualities."
```

Borges ends his story with this great quote by Chesterton on the inadequacy of language:

```markdown
He knows that there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless 
than the colours of an autumn forest... Yet he seriously believes that these things can every
one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be accurately
represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized
stockbroker can really produce out of this own inside noises which denote all the mysteries of
memory and all the agonies of desire.
```
