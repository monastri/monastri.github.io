Daniel Böttger’s [Rudyard Kipling and exactly why modern poetry systematically](http://sevensecularsermons.org/rudyard-kipling-and-exactly-why-modern-poetry-systematically-sucks/) sucks is great.

What does he mean by modern poetry sucking?

>I mean poetry of the type that properly educated poets write these days: as few words as possible, little meter and almost no rhyme, impressionistic, often ungrammatical, almost always aggressively pointless. I mean measly secretions like [this, rated the fifth best original poem ever posted on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/2ff31c/a_poem_constructed_solely_from_post_titles_on/) …

>Had the worst dream today.
>I almost didn’t get out of bed.

>Why the hell is it getting worse?

>Is it possible I am depressed, or am I just overthinking things?

>I don’t know if I’m depressed or not.
>What’s an official diagnosis?

>I think of drivel like this as the polar opposite of my favorite poet, Rudyard Kipling. He likes to go on a bit longer than necessary, he uses rhyme and meter and usually repeats phrases or entire lines to create more structure, has an explicit narrative and a coherent language and always a clearly discernible point. …

>My preference for Kipling makes me normal among non-poets. Kipling’s poem “If–” for example is one of the most famous poems ever written in the English language. … And my disdain for nearly all modern poetry is also [widely shared](https://scarriet.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/why-poetry-sucks-now/).

From the last link, which is Jerry Lewis’ WHY POETRY SUCKS NOW:

>We shall demolish the simple argument most commonly used to defend today’s poetry: Every era has good and bad poetry.

>Yes, every era has good and bad poetry, true.

>However, today we have something completely different: bad poetry is celebrated.

>To be faced with “good and bad poetry” is easy for the public, for it simply rejects the bad poetry and enjoys the good.

>But today poetry has no public, and for a very simple reason.

>It’s a no-brainer.

>The public has a deep mistrust of the product—and why?

>Not because the public is afraid of running into some bad poetry amid the good.

>The problem goes much deeper than that.

>The public has checked out because it doesn’t believe that good poetry is possible anymore.

>The public believes that poetry-at-large, poetry-in-the-main, poetry written and published today, is not operating with any standard of good and bad at all.

>This public perception is so overwhelmingly the fact, that it doesn’t matter that good poetry somewhere is being published—the public has no way of finding it.

I’m not sure I buy that ‘modern poetry systematically sucks’, but that’s mostly because I don’t read enough modern poetry to have a substantive opinion on the matter. I do agree with Lewis’ claim that the public perception is what he says it is. I’d also claim myself that GPT-2’s curated (but unchanged) outputs could probably pass a public Turing test if put side by side with some of the more lauded examples of today’s poetry.

Okay, why? Lewis offers a diagnosis:

>How did poetry lose its public? It lost it when the place it got made was removed from the public sphere and put in the university.

>This is known as the Creative Writing industry.

>Imagine a wine industry with no grapes, no wine-makers and no wine tasting.

>Imagine a wine industry—made entirely of wine critics who do nothing but write about wine.

>This, without any exaggeration, is where poetry—as an industry—is today.

Böttger’s own diagnosis is much more comprehensive; in fact it’s why I’m writing this post in the first place. He begins by agreeing with Lewis, except he puts it more cogently:

Poetry has entered the same failure mode that [architecture is also stuck in](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/why-you-hate-contemporary-architecture) and that is also at the core of the many problems of the humanities. Participants in these fields aren’t being judged by outsiders (the public), but by other insiders. So they optimize for what other participants like, not for what the public likes. This is a rational result of their pursuit of economic success, since by far the most likely path to long-term financial stability in these fields is a position in academia, preferably with tenure. These positions are given out based on the assessment of their peers, so that is who they optimize their work to please.

I think the likes of Peter Woit and Sabine Hossenfelder would argue that this is also what’s happening in string theory; for the latter see any of her gazillion recent posts over at [Backreaction](https://backreaction.blogspot.com/). John von Neumann also once said the same in his article [The Mathematician Part 2](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Part_2.html):

>I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth — which is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations — that mathematical ideas originate in empirics, although the genealogy is sometimes long and obscure.

>But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, than to anything else and, in particular, to an empirical science.

>There is, however, a further point which, I believe, needs stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from "reality" it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely I'art pour I'art.

>This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste.

>But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much "abstract" inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up.

But I digress. What are, per Böttger, modern poetry’s main problems?

It isn’t that poets today are less talented. In fact, Böttger says “they could do better than he ever did: after all they’re much more numerous, have way more time on their hands, have better tools such as rhyming dictionaries and aren’t stuck espousing some of Kipling’s terrible ideas, such as colonialism and Christianity“. The issue is that they’re stuck in what Eliezer Yudkowsky calls an [inadequate equilibrium](https://equilibriabook.com/); it’s hard to break out of without incurring “severe financial penalty”.

The problems:

**No devastating criticism**. This is the big one. When you’re judged by your fellows everyone holds back, because they’re going to be on the receiving end another day, and because everyone may plausibly meet again. This is different from the entertainment market, which delivers brutal judgement and makes the vast majority of artists eventually give up and get a regular job. Guess what, without that weeding out of poor and mediocre work, quality not only becomes much less obvious, it also becomes much less clearly the thing to aim for.

**Lack of popularity**. When you do your work for the tenure committee, disregarding the public, the public will quickly stop expecting anything good from you. This gives a hypocritical veneer to the self-serving but sensible choice to disregard the tastes of the public: since “they don’t get it” anyway, disregarding them feels justified.

**Long-term lack of improvement despite this unpopularity**. This is not just a single generation of poets, and architects, and scholars, going through a weird abortive fashion, it is a structural problem of incentives clad in a veneer of hypocritical norms. Any individual artist can defect from the consensus only by sacrificing their own chance of any financial stability. Incentives dominate everything and the incentives here completely overpower individual artistic choices.

**Emphasis on originality rather than individual merit**. Other poets will have seen many more poems than members of the public ever will, and they’ll be bored if you just do the thing that everyone knows will work, and that everyone knows most normal people want. In architecture you don’t just do ornament and plants. In the humanities you don’t just collect a large amount of data and produce testable predictions. And in poetry you don’t just do what Kipling did.

**Many creations in low effort formats**. A corollary of optimizing for originality. To produce original ideas you mostly have to have lots of ideas, not refine and polish just one or two for a long time. This punishes highly structured formats such as the common metre that take a long time to get right and rewards “free verse” (really often just pretty thoughts with too many line breaks) because that can be jotted down in a few inspired seconds.

**Praise for sophistication (rather than for good prima facie aesthetics or functionality)**. To praise sophistication serves two purposes: it reinforces the field’s ivory tower norms and it compliments the person doing the praising, because it takes sophistication to know sophistication. Unfortunately some unsophisticated tools like the light/night/bright or breath/death rhymes just work, and to neglect them in favor of sophistication is to lose something of value.

**No direct competition on the level of individual works**. It would be considered a crass violation of norms to take someone else’s work and explicitly attempt to improve upon it. Because that would imply direct criticism. Of course you can be, even should be, “inspired by” other work without attempting to supersede it. This is again exactly the same thing in architecture and the humanities. Compare music, where cover versions of songs are a normal thing and it is not unusual for one version of a song to be widely considered the best one.

**Defectors leaving for other fields**. I speculate that like the previous points, this too is a wider trend. If you’d rather do good work than play the signaling games inside academia, you do have other options. I’ve already said that I think the best poets leave poetry for songwriting. For architects, I guess if you think you’re up for merciless judgement you can design retail spaces. And scholars who don’t mind more rigorous standards of quality can go into economics or into the life sciences. (This last one is what I did, so no doubt I’m being self-serving.) Of course this also perpetuates the system, as only the people who are satisfied enough with the state of things remain.

Again the financial incentive angle:

>Kipling was different also because of financial incentives. He was chiefly a journalist; he always aimed and trained to write in the way people liked and would easily remember. This includes poetry, arguably not the most important part of his writing. Kipling needed to optimize for popularity because he had to sell. What he did not need is approval of his peers. (By the time he got the Nobel Prize in Literature anyway, he was old enough to be stuck in the habit.)

>And the fact of the matter is that when it comes to poetry, the public wants it in the way Kipling wrote it: constrained by rules and regularity to distinguish it from easy normal writing and to make it more memorable, musical (implying rhyme and meter), narrative and with a clear subject matter.

Aside: check out [Orwell on Kipling](http://4umi.com/orwell/kipling), a long but well-written essay written in response to T.S. Eliot’s defensive preface of A Choice of Kipling’s Verse, with too many quotable paragraphs to include here.

I’ll include some anyway. Orwell doesn’t actually like Kipling at all, but tries to explain why Kipling’s verses have endured while his critics haven’t, in the process coining the term ‘good bad poet’ (emphases mine):

>The trouble is that whenever an aesthetic judgement on Kipling’s work seems to be called for, Mr. Eliot is too much on the defensive to be able to speak plainly. What he does not say, and what I think one ought to start by saying in any discussion of Kipling, is that most of Kipling’s verse is so horribly vulgar that it gives one the same sensation as one gets from watching a third-rate music-hall performer recite ‘The Pigtail of Wu Fang Fu’ with the purple limelight on his face, and yet there is much of it that is capable of giving pleasure to people who know what poetry means. At his worst, and also his most vital, in poems like ‘Gunga Din’ or ‘Danny Deever’, Kipling is almost a shameful pleasure, like the taste for cheap sweets that some people secretly carry into middle life. But even with his best passages one has the same sense of being seduced by something spurious, and yet unquestionably seduced.

>One can, perhaps, place Kipling more satisfactorily than by juggling with the words ‘verse’ and ‘poetry’, if one describes him simply as a **good bad poet**. He is as a poet what Harriet Beecher Stowe was as a novelist. And the mere existence of work of this kind, which is perceived by generation after generation to be vulgar and yet goes on being read, tells one something about the age we live in.

>There is a great deal of good bad poetry in English, all of it, I should say, subsequent to 1790. Examples of good bad poems—I am deliberately choosing diverse ones—are ‘The Bridge of Sighs’, ‘When all the world is young, lad’, ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’, Bret Harte’s ‘Dickens in Camp’, ‘The Burial of Sir John Moore’, ‘Jenny Kissed Me’, ‘Keith of Ravelston’, ‘Casabianca’. All of these reek of sentimentality, and yet—not these particular poems, perhaps, but poems of this kind, are capable of giving true pleasure to people who can see clearly what is wrong with them. One could fill a fair-sized anthology with good bad poems, if it were not for the significant fact that good bad poetry is usually too well known to be worth reprinting.

>It is no use pretending that in an age like our own, ‘good’ poetry can have any genuine popularity. It is, and must be, the cult of a very few people, the least tolerated of the arts. Perhaps that statement needs a certain amount of qualification. True poetry can sometimes be acceptable to the mass of the people when it disguises itself as something else. One can see an example of this in the folk-poetry that England still possesses, certain nursery rhymes and mnemonic rhymes, for instance, and the songs that soldiers make up, including the words that go to some of the bugle-calls. But in general ours is a civilization in which the very word ‘poetry’ evokes a hostile snigger or, at best, the sort of frozen disgust that most people feel when they hear the word ‘God’. If you are good at playing the concertina you could probably go into the nearest public bar and get yourself an appreciative audience within five minutes. But what would be the attitude of that same audience if you suggested reading them Shakespeare’s sonnets, for instance?

>Good bad poetry, however, can get across to the most unpromising audiences if the right atmosphere has been worked up beforehand. Some months back Churchill produced a great effect by quoting Clough’s ‘Endeavour’ in one of his broadcast speeches. I listened to this speech among people who could certainly not be accused of caring for poetry, and I am convinced that the lapse into verse impressed them and did not embarrass them. But not even Churchill could have got away with it if he had quoted anything much better than this. …

>The fact that such a thing as good bad poetry can exist is a sign of the emotional overlap between the intellectual and the ordinary man. The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain sections of his personality, and even then not all the time. **But what is the peculiarity of a good bad poem? A good bad poem is a graceful monument to the obvious**. It records in memorable form—for verse is a mnemonic device, among other things—some emotion which very nearly every human being can share. The merit of a poem like ‘When all the world is young, lad’ is that, however sentimental it may be, its sentiment is ‘true’ sentiment in the sense that you are bound to find yourself thinking the thought it expresses sooner or later; and then, if you happen to know the poem, it will come back into your mind and seem better than it did before. Such poems are a kind of rhyming proverb, and it is a fact that definitely popular poetry is usually gnomic or sententious. …

This is “poetry judged by insiders”, as far as I can tell, so I’m glad Kipling ignored the Orwells of his time. I’m firmly in the camp that says it’s good to have “graceful monuments to the obvious”, because that means we [take joy in the merely real](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x4dG4GhpZH2hgz59x/joy-in-the-merely-real).
