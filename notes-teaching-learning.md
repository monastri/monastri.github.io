## What is this?

This is the "technology and futurism" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Errors vs bugs
([overview](#overview))

Sarah Constantin is one of my favorite writers -- she appears a *lot* in these notebooks. She has a blog, [Otium](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/), and goes by celandine13 on LiveJournal. This quote on the *error vs bug model of learning* comes from her LJ essay [Errors vs Bugs and the End of Stupidity](https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html).

```markdown
A common mental model for performance is what I'll call the "error model."  In the error model, a person's 
performance of a musical piece (or performance on a test) is a perfect performance plus some random error.  
You can literally think of each note, or each answer, as x + c times epsilon_i, where x is the correct note 
/ answer, and epsilon_i is a random variable, iid Gaussian or something.  Better performers have a lower 
error rate c.  Improvement is a matter of lowering your error rate.  This, or something like it, is the model 
that underlies school grades and test scores. Your grade is based on the percent you get correct.  Your 
performance is defined by a single continuous parameter, your accuracy.

But we could also consider the "bug model" of errors.  A person taking a test or playing a piece of music is 
executing a program, a deterministic procedure.  If your program has a bug, then you'll get a whole class of 
problems wrong, consistently.  Bugs, unlike error rates, can't be quantified along a single axis as less or 
more severe.  A bug gets everything that it affects wrong.  And fixing bugs doesn't improve your performance 
in a continuous fashion; you can fix a "little" bug and immediately go from getting everything wrong to 
everything right.  You can't really describe the accuracy of a buggy program by the percent of questions it 
gets right; if you ask it to do something different, it could suddenly go from 99% right to 0% right.  You 
can only define its behavior by isolating what the bug does.

Often, I think mistakes are more like bugs than errors.  My clinkers weren't random; they were in specific 
places, because I had sub-optimal fingerings in those places.  A kid who gets arithmetic questions wrong 
usually isn't getting them wrong at random; there's something missing in their understanding, like not 
getting the difference between multiplication and addition.  Working generically "harder" doesn't fix bugs 
(though fixing bugs does require work). 

Once you start to think of mistakes as deterministic rather than random, as caused by "bugs" (incorrect 
understanding or incorrect procedures) rather than random inaccuracy, a curious thing happens.

You stop thinking of people as "stupid."

Tags like "stupid," "bad at X", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying "You're performing badly and I 
don't know why." Once you move it to "you're performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or 
"you're performing badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague personal 
failing but a causal necessity. Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. 

It's not you, it's the bug.

The rest of the linked article is *fantastic*. I had trouble quoting it because I felt like quoting everything.

<a name="#important-findings-on-learning"></a>
## Important findings on learning
([overview](#overview))

From the University of Missouri's [25 Learning Principles to Guide Pedagogy and the
Design of Learning Environments](http://whaaales.com/25principlesoflearning.pdf). I only picked those I found interesting. 

Contiguity Effects:

```markdown
Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time in the
multimedia learning environment. For example, the verbal label for a picture needs to be placed
spatially near the picture on the display, not on the other side of the screen. An explanation of an
event should be given when the event is depicted rather than many minutes, hours, or days later.
```

Perceptual-motor Grounding:

```markdown
Whenever a concept is first introduced, it is important to ground it in a concrete
perceptual-motor experience. The learner will ideally visualize a picture of the concept, will be
able to manipulate its parts and aspects, and will observe how it functions over time. The teacher
and learner will also gain a common ground (shared knowledge) of the learning material.

Perceptual-motor experience is particularly important when there is a need for precision, such as
getting directions to find a spatial location. For example, a course in statistics is not grounded in
perceptual-motor experience when the teacher presents symbols and formulae that have no
meaning to the student and cannot be visualized
```

Dual Code and Multimedia Effects:

```markdown
Information is encoded and remembered better when it is delivered in multiple modes
(verbal and pictorial), sensory modalities (auditory and visual), or media (computers and
lectures) than when delivered in only a singe mode, modality, or medium. Dual codes provide
richer and more varied representations that allow more memory retrieval routes. 

However, the amount of information should not overwhelm the learner because attention is 
split or cognitive capacities are overloaded.
```

Testing Effect:

```markdown
There are direct and indirect effects of taking frequent tests. One indirect benefit is that
frequent testing keeps students constantly engaged in the material. Although students will learn
from testing without receiving feedback, there is less forgetting if students receive informative
feedback about their performance. Multiple tests slow forgetting better than a single test.
Formative assessment refers to the use of testing results to guide teachers in making decisions
about what to teach. Learners also benefit if they use test results as a guide for their own
learning. 
```

The best way to do this is via spaced repetition. It's the whole idea behind Anki flashcards. See also [here](#augmenting-long-term-memory), as well as the next section -- Spaced Effects:

```markdown
Spaced schedules of testing (like spaced schedules of studying) produce better long-term
retention than a single test. When a single test is administered immediately after learning,
students obtain high scores, but long-term retention is reduced with a single immediate test
relative to spaced testing. When a test is given immediately after learning has occurred, learners
still have the newly-learned information in a primary memory system and therefore obtain high
test scores. Both teachers and learners often misjudge their high scores on a test given
immediately after learning as evidence of good retention, when, in fact, long-term retention
suffers with this practice
```

Generation Effect:

```markdown
Learning is enhanced when learners produce answers compared to having them recognize
answers. Free recall or essay tests which require the test taker to generate answers with minimal
cues produce better learning than multiple choice tests in which the learner only needs to be able
to recognize correct answers. In fact, free recall tests produce as much learning as restudying the
material
```

Organization effects (part of the reason this document exists in the first place!):

```markdown
Outlining, integrating, and synthesizing information produces better learning than rereading
materials or other more passive strategies. Students frequently report that when they study they
reread materials they already read once. Strategies that require learners to be actively engaged
with the material to-be-learned produce better long-term retention than the passive act of reading.
Learners should develop their own mini-testing situations as they review, such as stating the
information in their own words (without viewing the text) and synthesizing information from
multiple sources, such as from class and textbooks.
```

Coherence effect (Robert Frost does this well in [his answers on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Frost-1/answers)):

```markdown
The learner needs to get a coherent, well connected representation of the main ideas to be
learned. It is important to remove distracting, irrelevant material, even when the added
information is artistically appealing. Seductive details that do not address the main points to be
conveyed run the risk of consuming the learner’s attention and effort at the expense of their
missing the main points. 
```

Stories and example cases (see also [John Baez on why math publications should take a page from the storytelling skillbook](#why-math-is-boring)):

```markdown
Stories and other forms of narrative are easier to read, comprehend, and remember than
other types of learning materials. For many millennia, the primary way of passing wisdom down
from generation to generation was through stories. Stories have concrete characters, objects,
locations, plot, themes, emotions, and actions that bear some similarity to everyday experiences.
Many stories also convey a point or moral that can be generalized to many situations. Example
cases in a story-like format are persuasive, easy to comprehend, and very memorable. 
```

Negative suggestion effects:

```markdown
Just as people learn correct information with frequent testing, they also can learn wrong
information this way. For example, when incorrect alternatives on multiple choice tests are
presented, the wrong answers can be learned instead of the correct answers. This effect is also
found on short answer essay questions when students do not know the answers and use their
general knowledge about the field to construct a response that seems reasonable to them. In this
situation, learners recall their incorrect, but logically consistent response as being correct. These
effects can be reduced when learners receive feedback immediately after taking a test which
allows them to revise their memory and understanding without delay.
```

Desirable Difficulties (struggle promotes long-term recall -- true more so in math):
 
```markdown
Learning is enhanced when learners have to organize the information themselves or exert
additional effort during acquisition or retrieval than in conditions in which the information to be
learned or retrieved does not require effort. One possible explanation for this effect is that
learners create multiple retrieval paths which make the information more accessible at retrieval.
These practices slow initial learning, but promote long-term recall.
```

Explanation effects:

```markdown
Explanations consist of causal analyses of events, logical justifications of claims, and
functional rationales for actions. Explanations provide coherence to the material and justify why
information is relevant and important. Students may be prompted to give self-explanations of the
material through think aloud protocols or questioning tasks that elicit explanations that connect
the material to what they already know. Self-explanations and the activity of studying good
explanations facilitate deeper comprehension, learning, memory, and transfer. 
```

Deep questions:

```markdown
Deep explanations of material and reasoning are elicited by questions such as why, how,
what-if-and what-if not, as opposed to shallow questions that require the learner to simply fill in
missing words, such as who, what, where, and when. Training students to ask deep questions
facilitates comprehension of material from text and classroom lectures. The learner gets into the
mindset of having deeper standards of comprehension and the resulting representations are more
elaborate. 
```

Cognitive disequilibrium:

```markdown
Cognitive disequilibrium stimulates inquiry, curiosity, thinking, and deep questions,
which in turn lead to deeper learning. Cognitive disequilibrium occurs when there are obstacles
to goals, contradictions, conflicts, anomalous events, breakdown scenarios, salient gaps in
knowledge, uncertainty, equally attractive alternatives, and other types of impasses. When these
impasses occur, the learner needs to engage in reasoning, thought, problem solving, and planning
in route to restoring cognitive equilibrium. There is a higher incidence of deep questions,
thought, reasoning, and study efforts when learners undergo cognitive disequilibrium.
```

Goldilocks principle: 

```markdown
Assignments should not be too hard or two easy, but at the right level of difficulty for the
student’s level of skill or prior knowledge. The definition of the zone of proximal development
(ZPD) is a bit more technical: the difference in learning that occurs with versus without a
learning scaffold (e.g., tutor, teacher, text, and computer). Researchers have identified a number
of zones that reflect how much learning, memory, mastery, or satisfaction occurs along a
continuum of task difficulty and that is sensitive to individual differences among learners. When
the material is too easy for the learner, the student is not challenged and may get bored. When it
is too difficult, the student acquires very little and gets frustrated or tunes out
```

Anchored learning:

```markdown
Anchored learning occurs when students work in teams for several hours or days trying to
solve a challenging practical problem that matters to the student. The activity is linked to
background knowledge of the learner on a topic that is interesting. The problem is challenging,
so the learner needs to engage in problem solving and recruit multiple levels of knowledge and
skills. These activities are coherently organized around solving the practical problem. Examples
of anchored learning are problem-based curricula in medical schools where students work on
genuine medical cases and communities of practice where students try to solve problems of
pollution in their city.
