## What is this?

This is the "reading and writing" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

Relatedly, I aspire towards the vision Tiago Forte fleshes out in his [digital notes as second brain essay](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/edit/master/notes-memory-cognition-teaching-learning.md#Offload-thinking-to-second-brain).

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Books vs blogs
([overview](#overview))

Tech/biz strategy writer Ben Thompson [wrote](https://stratechery.com/2017/books-and-blogs/) that in his personal experience, "while books remained a fantastic medium for stories, both fiction and non, blogs were not only good enough, they were actually better for ideas closely tied to a world changing far more quickly than any book-related editorial process can keep up with":

```markdown
A book, at least a successful one, has a great business model: spend a lot of time and 
effort writing, editing, and revising it up front, and then make money selling as many 
identical copies as you can. The more you sell the more you profit, because the work has
already been done. Of course if you are successful, the pressure is immense to write 
another; the payoff, though, is usually greater as well: it is much easier to sell to
customers you have already sold to before than it is to find customers for the very first
time.

There is, though, at least from my perspective, a downside to this model: a book, by 
necessity, is a finished object; that is why it can be printed and distributed at scale.
The problem is that one’s thoughts may not be final; indeed, the more vital the subject,
the more likely a book, with its many-month production process, is to be obsolete the 
moment it enters its final state of permanence.

When I started Stratechery four years ago, with my 384 Twitter followers and little else,
the thought of writing a book never crossed my mind; not only did I not have a contract, 
I didn’t even have a topic beyond the business and strategy of technology, a niche I
thought was both under-served and that I had the inklings of a point of view on.

Since then it has been an incredible journey, especially intellectually: instead of 
writing with a final goal in mind — a manuscript that can be printed at scale — 
Stratechery has become in many respects a journal of my own attempts to understand 
technology specifically and the way in which it is changing every aspect of society 
broadly. And, it turns, out, the business model is even better: instead of taking on the 
risk of writing a book with the hope of one-time payment from customers at the end, 
Stratechery subscribers fund that intellectual exploration directly and on an ongoing 
basis; all they ask is that I send them my journals of said exploration every day in email
form.

To put it another way, at least in my experience, the lowly blog has fully disrupted the
mighty book: the former was long thought to be an inferior alternative, or at best, a 
complementary piece for an author looking to drum up an audience; slowly but surely, 
though, the tools have gotten better, everything from social media for marketing to 
Stripe for payments to WordPress for publishing to tools like Memberful for subscriber
management. It became increasingly apparent, to me anyways, that while books remained a 
fantastic medium for stories, both fiction and non, blogs were not only good enough, they
were actually better for ideas closely tied to a world changing far more quickly than any
book-related editorial process can keep up with.

## Fiction

<a name="#Vary-sentence-lengths"></a>
### Vary sentence lengths
([overview](#overview))

I actually don't know where exactly [this quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/373814-this-sentence-has-five-words-here-are-five-more-words) by Gary Provost comes from, but it's a classic:

```markdown
This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. 
But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. 
The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. 

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a
pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. 
And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable
length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of 
the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
```

<a name="#The-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-adverbs"></a>
### The road to hell is paved with adverbs
([overview](#overview))

From Stephen King:

```markdown
I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs and I will shout it from the rooftops. 
To put it another way, they're like dandelions. If you have one on your lawn it's pretty
and unique. If you fail to root it out, however, you find five the next day . . . fifty 
the day after that . . . and then, my brothers and sisters, your lawn is totally,
completely, and profligately covered with dandelions. By then you see them for the weeds 
they are, but by then it's--GASP!!--too late.

If you want to be a writer, then you must do two things above all others: read a lot and 
write a lot.

You must be prepared to do some serious turning inward toward the life of the imagination,
and that means, I'm afraid, that Geraldo, Keith Obermann, and Jay Leno must go. Reading 
takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it.

Must you write complete sentences each time, every time? Perish the thought.

It's always easier to kill someone else's darlings than it is to kill your own.
```

Note that this quote applies equally well to [nonfiction writing](#nonfiction).

<a name="#show-dont-tell"></a>
### Show, don't tell
([overview](#overview))

Veltzeh's [More on Writing: Show vs. Tell](http://veltzeh.livejournal.com/17035.html) argues against "show, don't tell":

```markdown
There is another thing about "showing" that bugs me, and it's that very often, when I read guides 
and such about how to "show" rather than "tell", the only thing I see in those guides is that 
"showing" conveys different information than "telling". They create different scenes. And of course
I have more problems with the scenes that "show".

When the scene is "shown", I have a hard time staying with the text and understanding what's going on.
If I'm not told what a particular thing means, it starts just seeming nonsensical to me. The author 
(and many readers) might understand the tone of voice of a character whose line is written in a certain
way, but I'm likely to miss it. And so I'll end up clueless as to the character's state of mind. Now,
if I was TOLD exactly what the character's state of mind is, no problem. I might be bad at imagining
certain emotions, but it's definitely easier to read exactly what it's supposed to be than to try to
find and guess what parts show it.

Maybe it's just me, though. That doesn't make me less frustrated with writing that routinely frustrates
me with what I often perceive as non sequiturs. Therefore, I hope that more writings BOTH "showed" AND 
"told"! At least I'm trying to aim for both showing and telling in my writings from now on.
```

This is interesting to me, because it runs counter to the standard advice.

### Abstract, example, full abstract
([overview](#overview))

Qiaochu Yuan comments on Luke Muehlhauser's post [Writing style and the typical mind fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7Q3MoE9YzFMxGZR7F/writing-style-and-the-typical-mind-fallacy):

```markdown
Rather than "abstract stuff first, examples later" or "examples first, abstract stuff later"
I prefer a hybrid approach: give as much of the abstract stuff as is necessary to motivate why
you're looking at the examples (which may be no abstract stuff at all), then give the examples,
then give the rest of the abstract stuff. The main application I have in mind is mathematical 
writing, where sometimes a definition is very hard to motivate without examples, but sometimes
the examples are very hard to motivate without looking at a previously well-understood abstraction
first. The problem I have with always giving examples first is that I often don't know what to do
with the examples if they haven't been properly introduced: where, in the filesystem of my brain,
should I be filing these things?
```

Qiaochu is a wonderful math expositor, one of the best in the business. See also [why most math writing sucks](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-math-physics.md#why-math-is-boring).

<a name="#Opening-lines"></a>
### Opening lines
([overview](#overview))

From [Stein on Writing](http://www.amazon.com/Stein-Writing-Successful-Techniques-Strategies/dp/0312254210/), some good examples of nonfiction opening lines:

```markdown
When it comes to shopping for a computer, the most important peripheral runs at 98.6 degrees 
Fahrenheit and is known as a friend.

Here on a stony meadow in West Texas at the end of 10 miles of unpaved road through mesquite-
covered, coyote-infested shurb land, several hundred bearers of a strategic commodity of the 
United States of America are gathered.
They are goats.

As the 155-millimeter howitzer shells whistled down on this crumbling city today, exploding 
into buildings all around, a disheveled stubble-bearded man in formal evening attire unfolded
a plastic chair in the middle of Vase Miskina Street. He lifted his cello from its case and 
began playing Albinoni's Adagio.
```

Repetition: 

```markdown
Yesterday morning Henry Sorbino walked into the K-Mart on Eleventh Street carrying an umbrella 
and walked out carrying an umbrella and someone else's purse.
```

Eye for detail:

```markdown
Carl Gardhof, his head held high as if he had done nothing wrong, was sentenced in Superior Court
to eighteen months in jail this morning.
```

In a story about the suspension of auto union talks because workers were loath to chip in for health care costs:

```markdown
Since learning last year that he had multiple sclerosis, Andy Torok has become less and less steady
on his feet, and his worries have accumulated along with the hand prints on his apartment's white walls.
```

Obituaries and memorial pieces:

```markdown
Andy Warhol, draftsman of shoes, is dead, and the people viewing his remains are mostly wearing
scuffed white sneakers.

A year after his death, the recurring image I associate with Raymond Carver is one of people 
leaning toward him, working very hard at the act of listening.
```

Autobiographies:

```markdown
Many problems confront an autobiographer, and I am confident that I have not solved them.

### Imprinting good writers
([overview](#overview))

Here's a comment by Scott Alexander on Luke Muehlhauser's LW post [Rhetoric for the good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SiGY7aah56HvGXxBJ/rhetoric-for-the-good) which I lost years ago, and am delighted to stumble upon again:

```markdown
There's that quote about how "the most important thing is sincerity, and if you can fake that, 
you've got it made." So there are two equal and opposite commandments for popular writing. First,
you've got to sound like you're chatting with your reader, like you're giving them an unfiltered 
stream-of-consciousness access to your ideas as you think them. Second, *on no account should you
actually do that*.

Eliezer is one of the masters at this; his essays are littered with phrases like "y'know" and 
"pretty much", but they're way too tight to be hastily published first drafts (or maybe I'm wrong 
and Eliezer is one of the few people in the world who can do this; chances are you're not). You've 
got to put *a lot of work* into making something look that spontaneous. I'm a fan of words like "sorta"
and "kinda" myself, but I have literally gone through paragraphs and replaced all of the "to some 
degrees" with "sortas" to get the tone how I wanted it.

I like inserting myself and my thought processes into things I write. It's a no-no in serious writing,
but in informal writing it can emphasize the informality and become endearing, a sort of "we can take 
off the masks now, because we're all friends here". This only works if your personal asides are actually
endearing to people, or at least not actively boring and off-putting, but if you get it right it lets 
you keep more spontaneity, since talking in first person is a natural impulse. As in everything, "first
learn the rules and the reasons for them, then break them as much as you want".

The real meat of writing comes from an intuitive flow of words and ideas that surprises even yourself. 
Editing can only enhance and purify writing so far; it needs to have some natural potential to begin with.
My own process here is to mentally rehearse an idea very many times without even thinking about writing.
Once I'm an expert at explaining it to myself or an imaginary partner, then I transcribe the explanation
I settle upon (some people say they don't think in words; I predict writing will not come naturally to
these people). *Then* I edit the heck out of it.

The best way to improve the natural flow of ideas, and your writing in general, is to read *really good 
writers* so much that you unconsciously pick up their turns of phrase and don't even realize when you're
using them. The best time to do that is when you're eight years old; the second best time is now.

Your role models here should be those vampires who hunt down the talented, suck out their souls, and absorb
their powers. Which writers' souls you feast upon depends on your own natural style and your goals. I've
gained most from reading Eliezer, Mencius Moldbug, Aleister Crowley, and G.K. Chesterton; I'm currently making
my way through Chesterton's collected works pretty much with the sole aim of imprinting his writing style into 
my brain.

Stepping from the sublime to the ridiculous, I took a lot from reading Dave Barry when I was a child. He 
has a very observational sense of humor, the sort where instead of going out looking for jokes, he just
writes about a topic and it ends up funny. It's not hard to copy if you're familiar enough with it. And
if you can be funny, people will read you whether you have any other redeeming qualities or not.

Getting imprinted with good writers like this will serve you for your entire life. It will serve you 
whether you're on your fiftieth draft of a thesis paper, or you're rushing a Less Wrong comment in
the three minutes before you have to go to work. It will even serve you in regular old non-written
conversation, because wit and clarity are independent of medium.

And it will also inform and limit your use of all the other rules above. Luke's fourth point - 
telling stories about characters taking actions - is a good one, but he very reasonably didn't start
this post off with a story about some student working on a term paper. There have been a few LW posts
that kind of seemed kludgy and artificial in adding characters and stories, and others that did it 
really well. Probably some very smart person could figure out why it succeeds somewhere and fails 
somewhere else, but it's easier to just cultivate the virtue that is nameless.

Some people say to write down everything and only edit later. I take the opposite tack. I used to 
believe that I rarely edited at all because I usually publish something as soon as it's done. Then
a friend watching me write said that she was getting seasick from my tendency to go back and forth 
deleting and rewriting the same sentence fragment or paragraph before moving on. Most likely the 
best writers combine both editing methods.
```

Scott's original comments came with links to examples of what he considered particularly good writing: [Eliezer](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/), [Mencius Moldbug](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html), [Aleister Crowley](http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm), [G.K. Chesterton](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.iv_1.html), [Dave Barry](http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/01/1992746/dave-barrys-2010-year-in-review.html). 

<a name="#microhumor"></a>
### Microhumor
([overview](#overview))

Scott's [Nonfiction writing advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) is specialized for argumentative topics, which isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it has gems. 

The one I keep returning to the most is the idea of *microhumor*:

```markdown
You’ve heard of microaggressions. Now try microhumor. It’s things that aren’t a *joke* in the 
laugh-out-loud told-by-a-comedian sense, but still put the tiniest ghost of a smile on your reader’s
face while they’re skimming through them.

I learned this art from Dave Barry and Scott Adams, both of whom are humor writers and use normal 
macrohumor, but both of whom pepper the spaces in between jokes with microhumor besides. Your best 
best is to read everything they’ve written, your second best bet is to listen to me fumblingly try 
to explain it.

Here’s a paragraph from my “about” page:

*Topics here tend to center vaguely around this meta-philosophical idea of how people evaluate 
arguments for their beliefs, and especially whether this process is spectacularly broken in a way
that may or may not doom us all.*

There are a couple of things here that might qualify as microhumor. Take “especially whether this
process is spectacularly broken in a way that may or may not doom us all”. It’s not really a *joke*.
If I were a comedian and recited that sentence, you wouldn’t start laughing. But it’s kind of funny
to be starting with what sounds like a pretty dry academic idea (“how people evaluate arguments for
their beliefs” and whether the process is broken), and then confound expectations with an exaggerated
(well, maybe) warning about it dooming us all. The phrase “may or may not doom us all” does the same
thing on a smaller scale: “may or may not” is a pretty reserved, careful sounding phrase, whereas
“doom us all” is obviously the opposite of reserved (I also like the similar construction “it might
have sort of kind of been the worst idea ever”).

You can actually go a long way toward microhumor just with hedge words (“vaguely”, “sort of”), 
exaggerations (“the worst thing ever”, “doom us all”), and sometimes the combination of the two.

I think this microhumor stuff is really important, maybe the number one thing that separates really 
enjoyable writers from people who are technically proficient but still a chore to read. Think about
it with a really simplistic behaviorist model where you keep doing things that give you little bursts
of reward, and stop doing things that don’t. There are only a couple of sources of reward in reading.
One of them is getting important insights. Another is hearing things that support your ingroups or
bash your outgroups. And a third – maybe the biggest – is humor. Who ever had trouble slogging through
a really hilarious book of jokes?

Nobody can be super funny all the time, and an article on the economic crisis filled with man-walks-
into-a-bar-style jokes would be jarring and weird. But micro-humor really works. It works at a background 
level where people don’t notice it working, and it makes people keep coming back for more.

Humor is also disarming. It’s hard to hate somebody who’s making you laugh. I don’t mean somebody who’s 
making bigoted jokes that offend you, or writing political cartoons about how awful your ingroup is.
Those people are easy to hate. I mean somebody who’s making you laugh, right now. If you can make people
laugh while challenging their cherished beliefs, you’ve got a tiny bit more good will than usual.
```

It turns out that many of my favorite writers are masters of microhumor. Steve Yegge is another one.

<a name="#the-art-of-plain-talk"></a>
### The art of plain talk
([overview](#overview))

Rudolf Flesch's book [The Art of Plain Talk](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HNDRLO/ref=nosim?tag=lukeprogcom-20) has a lot of great quotes. First, an observation: 

```markdown
Grammar is what makes sentences difficult. Conjugations, declensions, irregular verbs, ablatives,
subjunctives, and aorists, oh my!
```

Then a claim, persuasively made:

```markdown
It might help if we wrote in Chinese, the “grammarless” tongue. Chinese has no inflections. No cases.
No persons. No genders. No degrees. No tenses. No voices. No moods. No infinitives. No participles.
No gerunds. No irregular verbs. No articles. No prefixes or suffixes.

This is not because Chinese is primitive. Chinese was once an irregular, complicated mess like 
English. But the Chinese people, generation after generation, changed it into a streamlined machine
for expressing ideas.

We say “A man bites a dog.” They say “Man bite dog.” We say “A dog is an animal.” They say “Dog: animal.” 
We say “The sun is bright and shiny.” They say “Sun shine.”

This may sound like baby talk. But look closely and you will see that Chinese offers the same meaning 
without the baggage.

Now look at English. We have the word 'sign', meaning “a mark.” Add a suffix and you get 'signify', “to make
a mark.” Add another suffix and you have 'significant', “making a mark.” Add a prefix and you have 
'insignificant', “making no mark.” Add another suffix for 'insignificance', “the making of no mark.” We took
a simple noun and made it into a verb, an adjective, another adjective, and again a noun.

After all those complications, we can be philosophical and talk about the *insignificance of man*. The
Chinese would just talk about *man no mark*.

Good writers work hard to make the abstract concrete. The Chinese have no abstract words to begin with. 
English philosophers may write that “The health of societies is not benefited by a mass of individuals
desiring radical differentiation from each other, nor by a mass of individuals lacking independent thought
and action.” Chinese philosophers say “Do not be rare like jade or common like stone.”
```

At this point I'm of two minds. I like where Flesch is getting at, but don't like the complete lack of abstract words to work with. Abstraction is a double-edged sword, not an unalloyed evil.

But let's go with Flesch -- how might we write more plainly?

```markdown
Once, I was reading a philosophy essay of mine to my girlfriend. She could barely understand it. 
“Why don’t you just say it like you said it to me yesterday?” she asked.

As hard as it is to write in plain talk, we speak in plain talk all the time. What is it about our
talking that is clearer than our writing?

When speaking, we may use big words and a fast pace and complex grammar, but we give the other person 
time to understand us. We repeat ourselves. We use filler words. We pause.

But when writing, we eliminate all repeated and irrelevant words. If every word is important, the 
reader may not have time to digest what is being said because your ideas are coming at him too quickly.

We write like this: “Perhaps the toughest intellectual work we must do regarding European reconstruction
is to realize that it can be achieved through nonpolitical instrumentalities. Reconstruction will not be
politics, but engineering.”

We talk like this: “We have a tough job ahead of us, I think. Reconstructing Europe is a tough job, and 
it’s a job of thinking; of figuring out how to do it. We can’t do it with politics, I don’t think. No, 
it won’t be done with politics. It’ll be more like building a bridge; more like engineering. That’s the
way I see it, anyway.”

The first version is concise. It moves rapidly and requires strict concentration. But readers are 
surrounded by distractions. They need the repetition, pauses, and filler of the second version to keep 
up with your thought, or else they may have to read your sentences twice. Put space between your ideas.

We might combine the clarity of the first version with the readability of the second version like this:
“We have a tough job ahead of us. We need to figure out how to reconstruct Europe. It won’t happen with
political forces. The European reconstruction will be a matter of engineering, not politics.”
```

Flesch on avoiding brevity for brevity's sake:

```markdown
Simplicity and brevity are not the same thing. Plain talk can be slow. Condensed sentences are often tough
to read.

Brevity-worship can lead you to use confusing abbreviations, such as the famous Variety headline: STIX NIX
HIX PIX. To loyal Variety readers, this meant that small-town moviegoers disliked rural pictures. To the 
rest of us, it meant nothing.

Condensed writing is for experts. Plain talk is for everyone else. Consider this sentence: “We need long-
range planning for industrialization with long-term credit financing, decent wage guarantees, protection of
national interests and equal participation of domestic and foreign capital.”

We need lots of simple words to translate all those big words into plain English. Here, simplifying means 
*lengthening*, not shortening. Brevity is great, but simplicity is greater.
```

Engaging human interest:

```markdown
We know nothing better than ourselves. We speak and think best about us. That’s why it is a bit easier to
read and understand “Stalin drinks vodka” than “Vodka contains alcohol.” Give your writing human interest.

Newspapers add human interest to a scene by giving an eyewitness report. Scientific findings are reported 
as an unraveling mystery; the scientists as detectives. Public policy reporting is given from the 
biographical view of the persons pushing for policy change.

How might we engage human interest in this bland paragraph? “Du Pont this week announced a new product as
potentially profitable as its nylon. It is wood impregnated with chemicals that transform it into a hard,
polished material. Wood so treated does not warp, split, or shrink.”

It is easy to give your writing human interest. Look at each sentence and find the logical—not the 
grammatical—subject. The logical subject of almost everything that humans care about is human.

Who announced a new product? A corporation? No, people announced a new product: “The Du Pont people this
week announced…”

Next: Who impregnated the wood? The Du Pont people! So: “They have impregnated wood…”

But isn’t the subject of the next sentence wood? To find the logical subject in this sentence, ask: How do 
you know? Well, how does anyone know a scientific fact? By testing. So: “Their tests show that wood so 
treated does not warp…”

Our revised paragraph is less concise. But that gives our readers time to keep up with our thought. And 
now, the paragraph is about our readers’ favorite subject, people: “The Du Pont people this week announced
a new product as potentially profitable as its nylon. They have impregnated wood with chemicals that
transform it into a hard, polished material. Their tests show that wood so treated does not warp, split, 
or shrink.”
