## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Wayne Barlowe's hell
([overview](#overview))

From [Wayne Barlowe](https://waynebarlowe.com/artwork/hell/), one of my favorite artists of all time.

Eligor, God's Demon:

What Remains:

![what remains](https://waynebarlowe.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/what-remains-copy-2.jpg?w=950&h=631)

Barlowe:

	As much as Hell is a place of unrelenting horror and savagery it is, too, a place 
	of sadness. What else could a being once of Heaven feel than sadness finding itself
	in such an environment? And what more poignant, precious reminder of its former
	existence could it possess after its Fall than one of its own charred feathers?

## How people thought the future would be like
([overview](#overview))

From David S. Zondy's [Tales of Future Past](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/index.html) website, which I loved as a kid. What I emphatically *didn't* like about it was David's nonstop sneering. Thanks truly for compiling these pictures, since I'll never get them anywhere else, but fuck your cynicism, David.

My favorite section was the one on cities. Two schools of thought on the skylines of tomorrow. One was Brutalist High Modernism of the sort Scott Alexander discussed in his book review of James Scott's [Seeing Like a State](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/):

	The first is that of the "serious" architects -- the sort Modernist dreamers
	that did away with all that bourgeois ornamentation and obsolete classical
	nonsense in favour of good, clean lines suitable for the enlightenment of 
	the proletariat who didn't know what was good for them. 

	They loved to plop down great slabs of brick that were cities unto themselves
	in vast plains of concrete dotted with trees that gave no shade, marble 
	benches that no human being could sit comfortably on, steps that were so wide
	and low that they made you walk like a duck, and nothing to give any pedestrian
	any protection from the elements. In the summer you roasted under the sun and
	in the winter you froze in the raw northern winds. But it gave the paperboard
	models a wonderful sense of perspective.

	It's all horrible, so why do it?  Because it was all so anti-bourgeois and it
	was the sort of place where, in the words of Alexi Sayle, "They expected working
	class people to wander around discussing Chekhov."

The second was the Romantics, a school I'm emphatically in:

	The other school came from the wild and free imaginations of the pulp magazine
	artists. These underpaid, underappreciated toilers in the fields of lurid 
	fiction weren't concerned about making a great social statement in steel and 
	glass, but in meeting their deadlines and collecting their meagre fees. Their
	school wasn't an allegiance to Bauhaus or Dada, but to spectacle, unbridled
	enthusiasm -- and rocket ships on the roof.

	The pulp cities could be as frighteningly inhuman as anything to come from the
	drawing boards of "proper" architects, but pulp had one great advantage: they 
	were exciting. They were cities where Adventure lurked, where anything could 
	happen, and where you at least got a great  view of the sky bridges as Blackie
	Ben tossed you out of the 200th story window of Atomic Towers

	In other words, what the pulp school of future architecture offered was Romance,
	and that's something we've been sorely lacking of late.

Here's Frank R. Paul:

![city-frank-paul](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Futurecity-01.jpg)

David comments:

	The city is a massive pile of steel, plastic and glass put together in a way 
	that not only has no past, but actively rejects it.  It is a place of heroic
	technology with skyscrapers the size of whole districts, roof-top aerodromes,
	wide pedestrian boulevards, and metal roadways strangely devoid of traffic. 
	There are even urban space launch pads where giant rockets are winched upright
	before blasting off to the heavens.  Noise regulations, Shmoise regulations.

Why doesn't this make sense? Because most cities aren't like Brasilia or Putrajaya, they have pasts and local histories. That's what makes New York different from London different from Los Angeles different from Tokyo different from Moscow different from Dubai.

The early artist-prophets were obsessed with gigantism, which I fully share. Here's a rather Brutalist depiction from the movie *Metropolis* (1926):

![city-metropolis-1926](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Metropolis-01.jpg)

This is New York 2032, one of my favorite future-city depictions of all time, from a 1932 edition of what's probably the precursor to *Popular Science*:

![new-york-2032](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/newyork_2032.jpg)

David: 

	Look at this prediction of a future New York City from 1932.  On the lower 
	centre of the painting you can see a very small Empire State Building, which
	was clearly preserved by the City Fathers to merely provide scale.  The 
	building across the road is at least twice as tall and four by six city blocks
	wide. The one behind it is even taller. Heck, the ornamental carvings holding
	up the clock are nearly as tall as the Empire State Building! You'll also 
	notice that not only are there sky bridges to keep the proles off the ground 
	and aerodromes on top of various buildings, but one has a hanger big enough 
	to hold several zeppelins!
	
	These people weren't thinking of buildings as buildings, but as little self-
	contained cities where people would live out their lives for weeks at a time
	without ever approaching the ground. 
	
*Love* the idea of self-contained-city-buildings. (Living in it? Different story...) A 1939 description of living in this sort of future city:

A vision of New York 50 years hence from the 1930 movie *Just Imagine*:

![just-imagine-ny](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Just-Imagine.jpg)

This is another of my all-time favorites, *Echo City* from 1908:

![city-1908-piccadilly](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Echocity.jpg)

David: 

	It's like living in a weird combination of an Arab sukh and the Grand Canyon
	with Piccadilly Circus stuck out on a bridge for good measure. Also, take a
	look at the copy of the Bridge of Sighs in the distance -- the one that's 
	about the size of the Houses of Parliament. 

	The really frightening thing is that you have no idea of how high you are in
	this picture. Is that the ground level in the distance, or does it just go on
	and on down?
	
A future London set in 1950 from the Grey's Cigarette Company:

![grey-city-london](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/greys01.gif)

David:

	It's pretty impressive for an advert. You've got your giant skyscrapers, city-
	spanning domes, sky bridges, and even advertising with phonetic spelling. And 
	note the transportation system with all manner of monorails and trams. Sure, 
	going north or south is a breeze, but cross town takes you the better part of
	a day.
	
The Century Globe:

Inside:

![inside-century-globe](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/20cen-02.jpg)

David: 

	Inside, there were supposed to be full-scale examples of every machine of the
	industrial age; including an airship and an ocean liner! There were also plans
	for a planetarium ten stories high, a "mammoth" ballroom that would have 
	covered a city block, theatres, lecture halls, and a distinctly impractical
	observatory.

Rooftop aerodromes:

King Camp Gillette (the razor tycoon):

![gillette-city](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/kcg-01.gif)

David:

	Gillette used his time and fortune to promote various utopian socialist ideas
	for a more efficient world  run by engineers. As part of his efficiency drive,
	Gillette recommended building a gigantic city in the vicinity of Niagara Falls
	made up of forty thousand buildings like these, which would hold the entire 
	population of North America.
	
David sneers a lot in his description here (which I left out), but [I know where Gillette comes from](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/). 	

Mario Chattonne's apartments:

Hugh Ferris' city is lit only from ground level by arc lamps, it seems:

Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City was a reaction to Internationalism:

![flw-city](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/broadacre.gif)

David:

	Where others foresaw phalanxes of skyscrapers trying to top one another or
	suburban developments fringed by industrial parks, Wright envisioned a "city"
	where each family lived in a house on an acre of land with the rolling hills
	punctuated by a scatter of towers and the odd electric factory.
	
Buckminster Fuller's Harlem River Project:

![buck-fuller-harlem](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/fullerhudson.jpg)

The Reverend Louis Tucker's Cubic City, the New York City of the future from 1929, was to be a single building 2 miles on a side (so *way* larger than Ultima Tower or even X-Seed 4000). 800 floors, pop. 80 million, "giant rooftop airfield and zeppelin moorings to boot":

![cubic-city](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/city-cube.jpg)

H.G. Wells' *Everytown*:

![hgwells-everytown](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Everytown-01.jpg)

Air-raid-proof underground cities, from Lyman Mason in 1924:

![underground-city](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/underground01.jpg)

David:

	Ever since the first Zeppelin raids on London during the First World War there
	has been the question of how to make cities air raid proof. ... One of the more
	frequent proposals (and least popular, I might add, unless you're H. G. Wells.)
	was moving urban populations underground where they would be "safe" from attack,
	such as in this depiction above from 1924 by Lyman Mason. Not only does Mr.
	Mason show a neat little American burg transplanted into a self-sufficient 
	community/arms factory, but it all looks rather pleasant and cozy without the 
	ventilation or flooding problems that real-life excavations are plagued with. 
	I love the fact that Mr. Mason has his underground city camouflaged against
	enemy detection.  
	
Under Manhattan, post-WWII when the atomic bomb scare was near its peak:

Hugo Gernsback's floating city 10,000 years hence, from 1922:

![hugogernsback](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/city-0002.jpg)

Hugo himself:

	This illustration reproduced from the magazine SCIENCE AND INVENTION of February
	1922, shows a city 10,000 years hence as conceived by Hugo Gernsback, and based
	on a prediction by Captain Lawson of aerial fame. The city the size of New York
	will float several miles above the surface of the earth, where the air is cleaner
	and purer and free from disease carrying bacteria. Gravity-nullifying devices
	were pictured as the means of keeping the cities suspended. Four gigantic
	generators will shoot earthward electric rays which by reaction with the earth 
	produce the force to keep the city aloft. By increasing of decreasing the 
	electrical energy the city may be raised or lowered as desired. The city is
	roofed over by a substance which is transparent, strong and unbreakable. The 
	atmospheric pressure within the city will probably be four or five pounds per 
	square inch instead of 14.7, as it now is. Possibly, therefore, future men will 
	have larger chests than we do. Furthermore, by rising above the clouds we will be
	freed from rain, snow and thunder showers. We will have in fact perpetual sunlight.
	The city will derive its energy from the sun, the solar energy being converted into
	electrical energy.
	
Clean Air Park (1959):

Rotating aerodrome from 1960: 

![rotating aerodrome](https://davidszondy.com/futurepast/images/Futurama-06.jpg)

David:

	There aren't any runways, because none are needed. It is a gigantic disk floating
	on a pool of oil with all the hangers and other building riding upon it. The idea 
	was that the aerodrome could be rotated so that it sat in the best direction in 
	relation to the wind.
