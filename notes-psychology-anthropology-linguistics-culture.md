## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Pirahã
([overview](#overview))

From Gwern Branwen's [book reviews](https://www.gwern.net/Book-reviews), in particular Daniel Everett's imaginatively-titled anthropology/linguistic memoir [*Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle*](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0375425020&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks&tag=gwernnet-20) about the now-famous Pirahã people and their language.

What are the Pirahã like? Gwern writes that Everett came back with "a sketch of a society which is horribly fascinating":

	Unlike the controversial Ik, the Pirahã have been documented as existing
	for centuries in apparently identical to their current form
	
Their famous language:

	Their language’s only relation is extinct, and the Pirahã language is a 
	language isolate, without counting or recursion or color words or comparisons
	or quantifiers or pluralization or disjunctions, minimal phatic elements, 
	and so few sounds that it can be whistled, hummed, yelled, sung, or spoken, 
	but also evidential grammar which indicates if the speaker is speaking of 
	something from personal knowledge; all current Pirahã speak only small 
	fragments and phrases of Portuguese or other major Brazilian languages 
	(renaming foreigners in Pirahã in order to talk about them), and are despite
	8 months of enthusiastic effort (to avoid being constantly cheated by river
	traders and understand money) are unable to learn to count to ten (making 
	Everett’s ability to predict when resupply airplanes come nigh magical to 
	the Pirahã), add any numbers, draw straight lines, or write.
