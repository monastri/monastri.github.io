## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Pirahã
([overview](#overview))

From Gwern Branwen's [book reviews](https://www.gwern.net/Book-reviews), in particular Daniel Everett's imaginatively-titled anthropology/linguistic memoir [*Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle*](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0375425020&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks&tag=gwernnet-20) about the now-famous Pirahã people and their language.

What are the Pirahã like?
