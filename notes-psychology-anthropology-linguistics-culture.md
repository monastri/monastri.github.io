## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Pirahã
([overview](#overview))

From Gwern Branwen's [book reviews](https://www.gwern.net/Book-reviews), in particular Daniel Everett's imaginatively-titled anthropology/linguistic memoir [*Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle*](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0375425020&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks&tag=gwernnet-20) about the now-famous Pirahã people and their language. It's the closest description I've ever seen in print to an alien encounter, albeit in human form. 

What are the Pirahã like? Gwern writes that Everett came back with "a sketch of a society which is horribly fascinating":

	The Pirahã are, like Luria’s peasant, ruled by an “immediacy of experience
	principle” and this yields an extraordinarily conservative culture on which
	new ideas and concepts roll off like so much water off a duck’s back.
	
	Unlike the controversial Ik, the Pirahã have been documented as existing
	for centuries in apparently identical to their current form. ...
	
	No Pirahã is ever mentioned as learning well another language, converting
	to a religion, leaving the villages for the wider world, or mating with an
	outsider (nor outsiders ever accepted into the Pirahã).
	
	Everett recounts that the Pirahã lusted after fine river canoes, and he 
	arranged for a skilled canoe builder to come and teach them and even bought
	the necessary tools as a gift to the Pirahã, and they enthusiastically made
	a canoe; 5 days later, they suddenly refused to make another one, saying 
	“Pirahãs don’t make canoes”.
	
	They seem to need relatively little sleep, mature quickly...
	
	Growing and harvesting manioc is universal in the Amazon despite the need 
	to process it to remove cyanide, but Everett says the Pirahã only grow & 
	process manioc under the influence of an earlier missionary.
	
	Burials are ad hoc, and bigger men will be buried sitting because, the Pirahã 
	say, you need to dig less.
	
Their famous language:

	Their language’s only relation is extinct, and the Pirahã language is a 
	language isolate, without counting or recursion or color words or comparisons
	or quantifiers or pluralization or disjunctions, minimal phatic elements, 
	and so few sounds that it can be whistled, hummed, yelled, sung, or spoken, 
	but also evidential grammar which indicates if the speaker is speaking of 
	something from personal knowledge; all current Pirahã speak only small 
	fragments and phrases of Portuguese or other major Brazilian languages 
	(renaming foreigners in Pirahã in order to talk about them), and are despite
	8 months of enthusiastic effort (to avoid being constantly cheated by river
	traders and understand money) are unable to learn to count to ten (making 
	Everett’s ability to predict when resupply airplanes come nigh magical to 
	the Pirahã), add any numbers, draw straight lines, or write.
	
... which segues into their Chinese room perspective (seemingly brought about by total lack of cognitive empathy):

	They have difficulty understanding foreigners are like them, and can understand 
	language, in a bizarre echo of the Chinese room:
	
		Then I noticed another bemusing fact. The Pirahãs would converse 
		with me and then turn to one another, in my presence, to talk about
		me, as though I was not even there. “Say, Dan, could you give me 
		some matches?” Xip06gi asked me one day with others present. “OK, 
		sure.” “OK, he is giving us two matches. Now I am going to ask for 
		cloth.” Why would they talk about me in front of my face like this,
		as though I could not understand them? I had just demonstrated that
		I could understand them by answering the question about the matches.
		What was I missing?

		Their language, in their view, emerges from their lives as Pirahãs 
		and from their relationships to other Pirahãs. If I could utter 
		appropriate responses to their questions, this was no more evidence
		that I spoke their language than a recorded message is to me evidence
		that my telephone is a native speaker of English. I was like one of
		the bright macaws or parrots so abundant along the Maici. My 
		“speaking” was just some cute trick to some of them. It was not
		really *speaking*.
	
Their absolute presentism/concretism, which Everett calls an "immediacy of experience principle", and which bleeds over into relationships/family:

	[They] never plan ahead or make long-term investments (such as making wicker 
	rather than palm leave baskets) or talk about the distant future/past (and 
	will very rarely talk about anything they learned from someone now dead:
	“generally only the most experienced language teachers will do this, those
	who have developed an ability to abstract from the subjective use of their
	language and who are able to comment on it from an objective perspective”),
	and will casually throw away tools or things they will need soon. They know
	how to preserve meat, but never both unless intending to trade it; food is 
	eaten whenever it’s available, and since they fish at all hours, everyone 
	might wake up at 3AM for fish.
	
	They have no oral tradition but tell short repetitive stories of things that
	happened to them or someone they knew, no myths or origin stories (when asked:
	“Well, the Pirahãs say that these things were not made.”), no relationships 
	closer than grandparents (about the most distant directly observable given
	that Everett puts their life expectancy in the 40s, leading to minimal incest 
	taboos, forbidding only full siblings or parents or grandparents).
	
	…something that I thought would make them understand how important God can be
	in our lives. So I told the Pirahãs how my stepmother committed suicide and how
	this led me to Jesus and how my life got better after I stopped drinking and 
	doing drugs and accepted Jesus. I told this as a very serious story. When I 
	concluded, the Pirahãs burst into laughter. This was unexpected, to put it
	mildly. I was used to reactions like “Praise God!” with my audience genuinely
	impressed by the great hardships I had been through and how God had pulled me 
	out of them. “Why are you laughing?” I asked. “She killed herself? Ha ha ha. 
	How stupid. Pirahãs don’t kill themselves” they answered. They were utterly 
	unimpressed. It was clear to them that the fact that someone I had loved had 
	committed suicide was no reason at all for the Pirahãs to believe in my God. 
	Indeed, it had the opposite effect, highlighting our differences.

Supernatural beliefs and dreams are interpreted literally:

	Dreams are simply interpreted literally and discussed as supernatural events
	that happened, and any random thing can be a ‘spirit’, with regular theatrical
	performances of ‘spirits’ who are obviously tribe men...
	
	Some of the spirit appearances are group hallucinations or consensus, and 
	Everett opens *Don’t Sleep* with the anecdote of being part of a group of Pirahã
	staring at an empty sand bank where they see the spirit Xigagai saying he will
	kill anyone going into the forest that day. This example is a bit perplexing: 
	what could possibly be the use of this and why would they either perceive it or
	go along with it? 
	
	Similarly, it’s hard to see how the spirit outside the village talking all night
	about how he wanted to have sex with specific women of the village is serving any
	role, and the tribesman reaction when Everett walks up and asks to record his
	ranting is hilariously deadpan: “‘Sure, go ahead’, he answered immediately in his
	normal voice”. 
	
	Other spirits make more sense:
	
		Pirahãs listen carefully and often follow the exhortations of the 
		kaoaib6gi. A spirit might say something like “Don’t want Jesus. He
		is not Pirahã”, or “Don’t hunt downriver tomorrow”, or things that
		are commonly shared values, such as “Don’t eat snakes.” Through 
		spirits, ostracism, food-sharing regulation, and so on, Pirahã 
		society disciplines itself.
		
	The function and etiology of religion like this remains perplexing to me, but 
	as a method of egalitarian coercion, it does at least explain incidents like the
	Pirahã ordering Everett to stop preaching about Jesus because the spirit of 
	Jesus was causing trouble in another village and trying to rape their women with
	his three-foot long penis.	
	
Their weak grasp on personal identity:

	Any random thing can be a ‘spirit’, with regular theatrical performances of 
	‘spirits’ who are obviously tribe men (but when asked, Pirahã deny that there
	is any connection between particular men and spirits, part of their weak grasp
	on personal identity (I was particularly amused by the Heraclitean tone of one
	anecdote: “Pirahãs occasionally talked about me, when I emerged from the river
	in the evenings after my bath. I heard them ask one another, ‘Is this the same
	one who entered the river or is it kapioxiai [a dangerous spirit]?’”), where 
	names change regularly and are considered new people).
	
How they've lowered their expectations so much the jungle seems like paradise to them -- ft. Gwern's memorable "a cross between bonobos and Chimpanzees with wireheading thrown in to boot" analogy for them:

	Living by the plentiful river, with no native technology more advanced than
	a bow, the Pirahã have lowered their expectations to the point where the 
	jungle is paradise. If there is no food, then it is an opportunity to “harden”
	themselves and practice self-reliance. (This is deliberate, as it’s unlikely
	that if it was just the random chance of hunting, they would be so uniformly 
	100-125 pounds & 5-5.3 feet tall). The climate means they don’t need much 
	clothing or shelter, and if it’s raining, they can make a primitive hut. If
	they are hungry, they can go into the jungle and hunt. If there are foreigners,
	they can beg for food. They amuse themselves by talking and dancing and having
	sex and hunting and fishing and being self-reliant. They have no worries most 
	of the time, have few duties - even child-rearing is easy, as women give birth
	with little ceremony and die by themselves, the Pirahã are willing to euthanize 
	inconvenient infants, and much like the child-rearing practices described by 
	Jared Diamond, children are expected to injure themselves and learn - and are 
	happy. Reading about them, they come off as a cross between bonobos and 
	Chimpanzees with wireheading thrown in to boot.
	
Gwern is astonished as to how the Pirahã ever came to be in the first place, feeling that "culture" isn't sufficiently explanatory, and appealing to gene-environment co-evolution instead:

	I might believe in culture as an explanation, with the Pirahã being just the
	most extremely conservative surviving culture, if the claims were not so 
	extreme. But can that really be the case?

	Can we really appeal to culture as the explanation for why not a single Pirahã
	is literate, or can count, or has left the tribe to earn money, or brought a 
	non-Pirahã woman in as wife, or total cultural stasis for at least 300 years, 
	and all of the other singularities Everett claims? Is this the case for any
	other tribe ever, even the ones considered by their neighbors as the most
	primitive and least intelligent, like the Pygmies, or cases of cultural 
	regression like the Tasmanians? Have the Amish ever succeeded in having an 
	attrition rate <5%, and that with a relative level of wealth to the surrounding
	America far closer than the Pirahã relative to Brazilian? Why are all the other
	groups like the Warlpiri of Australia able to borrow numbers when numeral systems
	become useful, except the Pirahã? The Pirahã have been trading with Brazilians
	for at least two centuries, and have not taken any steps toward it. The endogamy
	and linguistic isolation is surprising; they seem more endogamous than the 
	Bushmen, whose lineage may have diverged scores of thousands of years ago, or the
	castes of India. They have, for all anyone knows, been separate for thousands of
	years... This alone, along with their small population (both present and 
	presumably founding), could yield major genetic drift on many traits.
	
	On the other hand, gene-environment co-evolution would make tremendous sense; 
	over millennia of reproductive isolation and specialization to their ecological
	niche, Pirahã have reached a local optimum where abstraction and planning are
	unnecessary and only lead to trouble and the potential for inequality, and either
	punishment or simply lack of additional fitness for such cognitive traits, which
	was continuously reinforced by natural & sexual selection over hundreds of
	generations (evolution does not stop at the neck), leading to a population many SDs
	from surrounding populations. (“I would go so far as to suggest that the Pirahãs 
	are happier, fitter, and better adjusted to their environment than any Christian or 
	other religious person I have ever known.” Indeed.) This would be similar to 
	Harpending & Cochran 2015’s model of the Amish. This parsimoniously explains the
	observations without the need for backflips in interpretation of many anecdotes.
	
They're embarrassed by what they don't know/have forgotten, and try to hide	it:

	If the Pirahã culture is so extraordinarily conservative, why did they eagerly learn
	to make canoes that they prize highly, saying that Pirahã canoes are bad, and only 5
	days later decide it was a bad idea? But Everett gives us a valuable clue in a 
	different anecdote:

		…I was surprised that the Pirahãs did not seem tired at all, however. 
		In the village the Pirahã men avoided carrying heavy things. When I 
		asked them for help in carrying boxes or barrels and such, they were 
		always reluctant to respond. When they did help, they could barely lift
		things that I could carry with ease. I had just assumed that they were
		weak and lacked endurance. But I was wrong. They didn’t normally carry
		foreign objects and they didn’t like to display their ignorance of how 
		to handle them.

	Like anyone else, they are embarrassed by what they don’t know - or have forgotten - 
	and when asked, will make up excuses or dodge it some other way. Similarly, the failure
	to teach counting does not require some sort of subtle Pirahã ploy where they pretend
	to be interested and to learn how to count for very practical reasons and then sabotage
	it to comply with the dictates of Pirahã culture; it was simply that difficult, and any
	teacher will be familiar with students on whom instructions are writ on water. 
	Supposedly a school was opened in 2012, so it would be interesting to hear whether a 
	Potemkin school (recent events doubtless having reminded everyone that the Brazilian 
	government has its fair share of problems with corruption & incompetence), what fraction
	ever enroll, how much attrition there is, and what performance levels any are able to reach.
