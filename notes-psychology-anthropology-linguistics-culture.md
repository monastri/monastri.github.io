## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

## Trivial inconveniences
([overview](#overview))

From Scott Alexander's [original 2009 post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences) introducing the idea. To quote [the wiki entry](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Trivial_inconvenience), they're "inconveniences that take few resources to counteract but have a disproportionate impact on people deciding whether to take a course of action".

Scott isn't sure how to explain it from a psychological standpoint:

	I don't know of any unifying psychological theory that explains our problem 
	with trivial inconveniences. It seems to have something to do with loss 
	aversion, and with the brain's general use of emotion-based hacks instead of
	serious cost-benefit analysis. It might be linked to akrasia; for example, 
	you might not have enough willpower to go ahead with the unpleasant action 
	of filling in a rebate form, and your brain may assign it low priority
	because it's hard to imagine the connection between the action and the 
	reward.

It does seem to point at a real cluster of related phenomena though. 

For instance, consider the Great Firewall of China:

	The Great Firewall of China. A massive system of centralized censorship purging
	the Chinese version of the Internet of all potentially subversive content. 
	Generally agreed to be a great technical achievement and political success even
	by the vast majority of people who find it morally abhorrent.

	I spent a few days in China. I got around it at the Internet cafe by using a 
	free online proxy. Actual Chinese people have dozens of ways of getting around
	it with a minimum of technical knowledge or just the ability to read some 
	instructions.

	The Chinese government isn't losing any sleep over this (although they also don't 
	lose any sleep over murdering political dissidents, so maybe they're just very
	sound sleepers). Their theory is that by making it a little inconvenient and 
	time-consuming to view subversive sites, they will discourage casual exploration.
	No one will bother to circumvent it unless they already seriously distrust the
	Chinese government and are specifically looking for foreign websites, and these 
	people probably know what the foreign websites are going to say anyway.

	Think about this for a second. The human longing for freedom of information is a
	terrible and wonderful thing. It delineates a pivotal difference between mental 
	emancipation and slavery. It has launched protests, rebellions, and revolutions. 
	Thousands have devoted their lives to it, thousands of others have even died for
	it. And it can be stopped dead in its tracks by requiring people to search for 
	"how to set up proxy" before viewing their anti-government website.
	
Michael Vassar points out that it might be less trivial inconvenience and more Big Brother paranoia:

	It seems to me that those Chinese who don't know that it's safe to go around 
	the government firewall may have no good way of finding out that it's safe. 
	Paranoia about how if they do they will get caught may be cultivated in them. 
	How do they know what methods the government has. Also, they may be made to 
	think that there is something dirty or illicit, wrong or ugly about going 
	outside official sources.

And public psychology is just different from what you'd expect sometimes, cf. Chen & Yang's ["The Impact of Media Censorship: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment in China"](https://stanford.edu/~dyang1/pdfs/1984bravenewworld_draft.pdf):

	Media censorship is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. We conduct a field 
	experiment in China to measure the effects of providing citizens with access
	to an uncensored Internet. We track subjects' media consumption, beliefs 
	regarding the media, economic beliefs, political attitudes, and behaviors over
	18 months. We find four main results:

	1. free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive
	information;
	2. temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, 
	indicating that demand is not permanently low;
	3. acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge,
	beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors; and
	4. social transmission of information is statistically-significant but small
	in magnitude.

	We calibrate a simple model to show that the combination of low demand for
	uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China's 
	censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving
	access to an uncensored Internet.

But I digress. Back to examples of trivial inconveniences. 

Customer differentiation via price discrimination, in this case free rebates:

	Companies frequently offer "free rebates". For example, an $800 television with a
	$200 rebate. There are a few reasons companies like rebates, but one is that 
	you'll be attracted to the television because it appears to have a net cost only
	$600, but then filling out the paperwork to get the rebate is too inconvenient and
	you won't get around to it. This is basically a free $200 for filling out an 
	annoying form, but companies can predict that customers will continually fail to 
	complete it. This might make some sense if you're a high-powered lawyer or someone
	else whose time is extremely valuable, but most of us have absolutely no excuse.
	
This is in fact the core idea behind [revenue management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_management). For the airline industry, I like Peter Belobaba's [MIT OCW notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-201j-transportation-systems-analysis-demand-and-economics-fall-2008/lecture-notes/MIT1_201JF08_lec17.pdf). 
	
Credit cards vs cash:

	It's become a truism that people spend more when they use credit cards than when 
	they use money. This particular truism happens to be true: in a study by Prelec 
	and Simester1, auction participants bid twice as much for the same prize when
	using credit than when using cash. The trivial step of getting the money and
	handing it over has a major inhibitory effect on your spending habits.	
	
Trivial inconvenience can be a benefit. Whereas the Great Firewall is an example of "soft" oppression, 'opt-out' government policies can be seen as examples of (one aspect of) "soft paternalism":

	For example, it would be nice if everyone put money into a pension scheme. Left
	to their own devices, many ignorant or lazy people might never get around to 
	starting a pension, and in order to prevent these people's financial ruin, 
	there is strong a moral argument for a government-mandated pension scheme. But
	there's also a strong libertarian argument against that idea; if someone for 
	reasons of their own doesn't want a pension, or wants a different kind of
	pension, their status as a free citizen should give them that right.

	The "soft paternalist" solution is to have a government-mandated pension scheme,
	but allow individuals to opt-out of it after signing the appropriate amount of
	paperwork. Most people, the theory goes, would remain in the pension scheme, 
	because they understand they're better off with a pension and it was only
	laziness that prevented them from getting one before. And anyone who actually 
	goes through the trouble of opting out of the government scheme would either be
	the sort of intelligent person who has a good reason not to want a pension, or
	else deserve what they get.
	
Jiro notes that between soft paternalism and outright bans there's a spectrum:

	There's a gradual shading from "soft paternalist" solutions to bans. Making
	someone take an extra 5 seconds to get their choice would probably not be 
	considered a ban by many people. What about a minute? An hour? A week? What if 
	it takes an hour, and you're a poor person who can't afford to get child care
	for the hour, or pay the taxi fare to go to the banned store on the outskirts 
	of town? What if buying and having the item increases your chance of being 
	harassed by the police, without the item itself being a crime to buy or have? 
	(This actually happens in some places with open carry of guns.) Or increases 
	the chance of child services coming and requiring you to go through months of 
	hearings to get your children back?
	
The major popular source on this subject is in fact Richard Thaler's [Nudge](http://www.nudges.org/), which I've seen in bookstores recently; given that the comment bringing it up was written in 2009, it seems prescient now.	

Kieran Healy [presents evidence to the contrary](http://crookedtimber.org/2008/04/09/psychology-vs-organizations-in-organ-procurement/):

	While opt-in vs. opt-out does make a difference to whether individuals agree to
	donate, this doesn't necessarily translate into differences in actual organ 
	procurement rates, and argues that the real bottlenecks in many countries are 
	organizational/logistical:
	
		It is not at all clear that consent laws per se have any strong effect
		on the procurement rate (as distinct from their effect on people’s
		attitudes). Even if most people support organ donation, there are still
		large logistical hurdles to be overcome at the point of procurement.
		It is investment in the procurement infrastructure that really makes
		the difference to rates of organ donation, even if default options to
		opt-in or opt-out have large effects on people’s professed willingness 
		to participate in the system.
	
	The apparent lesson: Don't assume that just by removing the obvious trivial
	obstacles, the problem will be solved. There may be less trivial obstacles
	lurking in the background.
	
Procedure can overcome trivial inconveniences. What Vladimir Nesov describes here is similar to my own process:

	The solution is to sidestep the technical inconveniences and write the text 
	using whatever tools you are most comfortable with, and then, after the text
	is written, deal with the inconveniences. This way, the inconveniences are 
	scheduled so that they don't stand between you and the important part of the
	task. (I write my posts in LaTeX, for example.)

<a name="#Pirahã"></a>
## Pirahã
([overview](#overview))

From Gwern Branwen's [book reviews](https://www.gwern.net/Book-reviews), in particular Daniel Everett's imaginatively-titled anthropology/linguistic memoir [*Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle*](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-isbn=0375425020&page=1&rh=i:stripbooks&tag=gwernnet-20) about the now-famous Pirahã people and their language. It's the closest description I've ever seen in print to an alien encounter, albeit in human form. 

What are the Pirahã like? Gwern writes that Everett came back with "a sketch of a society which is horribly fascinating":

	The Pirahã are, like Luria’s peasant, ruled by an “immediacy of experience
	principle” and this yields an extraordinarily conservative culture on which
	new ideas and concepts roll off like so much water off a duck’s back.
	
	Unlike the controversial Ik, the Pirahã have been documented as existing
	for centuries in apparently identical to their current form. ...
	
	No Pirahã is ever mentioned as learning well another language, converting
	to a religion, leaving the villages for the wider world, or mating with an
	outsider (nor outsiders ever accepted into the Pirahã).
	
	Everett recounts that the Pirahã lusted after fine river canoes, and he 
	arranged for a skilled canoe builder to come and teach them and even bought
	the necessary tools as a gift to the Pirahã, and they enthusiastically made
	a canoe; 5 days later, they suddenly refused to make another one, saying 
	“Pirahãs don’t make canoes”.
	
	They seem to need relatively little sleep, mature quickly...
	
	Growing and harvesting manioc is universal in the Amazon despite the need 
	to process it to remove cyanide, but Everett says the Pirahã only grow & 
	process manioc under the influence of an earlier missionary.
	
	Burials are ad hoc, and bigger men will be buried sitting because, the Pirahã 
	say, you need to dig less.
	
Their famous language:

	Their language’s only relation is extinct, and the Pirahã language is a 
	language isolate, without counting or recursion or color words or comparisons
	or quantifiers or pluralization or disjunctions, minimal phatic elements, 
	and so few sounds that it can be whistled, hummed, yelled, sung, or spoken, 
	but also evidential grammar which indicates if the speaker is speaking of 
	something from personal knowledge; all current Pirahã speak only small 
	fragments and phrases of Portuguese or other major Brazilian languages 
	(renaming foreigners in Pirahã in order to talk about them), and are despite
	8 months of enthusiastic effort (to avoid being constantly cheated by river
	traders and understand money) are unable to learn to count to ten (making 
	Everett’s ability to predict when resupply airplanes come nigh magical to 
	the Pirahã), add any numbers, draw straight lines, or write.
	
... which segues into their Chinese room perspective (seemingly brought about by total lack of cognitive empathy):

	They have difficulty understanding foreigners are like them, and can understand 
	language, in a bizarre echo of the Chinese room:
	
		Then I noticed another bemusing fact. The Pirahãs would converse 
		with me and then turn to one another, in my presence, to talk about
		me, as though I was not even there. “Say, Dan, could you give me 
		some matches?” Xip06gi asked me one day with others present. “OK, 
		sure.” “OK, he is giving us two matches. Now I am going to ask for 
		cloth.” Why would they talk about me in front of my face like this,
		as though I could not understand them? I had just demonstrated that
		I could understand them by answering the question about the matches.
		What was I missing?

		Their language, in their view, emerges from their lives as Pirahãs 
		and from their relationships to other Pirahãs. If I could utter 
		appropriate responses to their questions, this was no more evidence
		that I spoke their language than a recorded message is to me evidence
		that my telephone is a native speaker of English. I was like one of
		the bright macaws or parrots so abundant along the Maici. My 
		“speaking” was just some cute trick to some of them. It was not
		really *speaking*.
	
Their absolute presentism/concretism, which Everett calls an "immediacy of experience principle", and which bleeds over into relationships/family:

	[They] never plan ahead or make long-term investments (such as making wicker 
	rather than palm leave baskets) or talk about the distant future/past (and 
	will very rarely talk about anything they learned from someone now dead:
	“generally only the most experienced language teachers will do this, those
	who have developed an ability to abstract from the subjective use of their
	language and who are able to comment on it from an objective perspective”),
	and will casually throw away tools or things they will need soon. They know
	how to preserve meat, but never both unless intending to trade it; food is 
	eaten whenever it’s available, and since they fish at all hours, everyone 
	might wake up at 3AM for fish.
	
	They have no oral tradition but tell short repetitive stories of things that
	happened to them or someone they knew, no myths or origin stories (when asked:
	“Well, the Pirahãs say that these things were not made.”), no relationships 
	closer than grandparents (about the most distant directly observable given
	that Everett puts their life expectancy in the 40s, leading to minimal incest 
	taboos, forbidding only full siblings or parents or grandparents).
	
	…something that I thought would make them understand how important God can be
	in our lives. So I told the Pirahãs how my stepmother committed suicide and how
	this led me to Jesus and how my life got better after I stopped drinking and 
	doing drugs and accepted Jesus. I told this as a very serious story. When I 
	concluded, the Pirahãs burst into laughter. This was unexpected, to put it
	mildly. I was used to reactions like “Praise God!” with my audience genuinely
	impressed by the great hardships I had been through and how God had pulled me 
	out of them. “Why are you laughing?” I asked. “She killed herself? Ha ha ha. 
	How stupid. Pirahãs don’t kill themselves” they answered. They were utterly 
	unimpressed. It was clear to them that the fact that someone I had loved had 
	committed suicide was no reason at all for the Pirahãs to believe in my God. 
	Indeed, it had the opposite effect, highlighting our differences.

Supernatural beliefs and dreams are interpreted literally:

	Dreams are simply interpreted literally and discussed as supernatural events
	that happened, and any random thing can be a ‘spirit’, with regular theatrical
	performances of ‘spirits’ who are obviously tribe men...
	
	Some of the spirit appearances are group hallucinations or consensus, and 
	Everett opens *Don’t Sleep* with the anecdote of being part of a group of Pirahã
	staring at an empty sand bank where they see the spirit Xigagai saying he will
	kill anyone going into the forest that day. This example is a bit perplexing: 
	what could possibly be the use of this and why would they either perceive it or
	go along with it? 
	
	Similarly, it’s hard to see how the spirit outside the village talking all night
	about how he wanted to have sex with specific women of the village is serving any
	role, and the tribesman reaction when Everett walks up and asks to record his
	ranting is hilariously deadpan: “‘Sure, go ahead’, he answered immediately in his
	normal voice”. 
	
	Other spirits make more sense:
	
		Pirahãs listen carefully and often follow the exhortations of the 
		kaoaib6gi. A spirit might say something like “Don’t want Jesus. He
		is not Pirahã”, or “Don’t hunt downriver tomorrow”, or things that
		are commonly shared values, such as “Don’t eat snakes.” Through 
		spirits, ostracism, food-sharing regulation, and so on, Pirahã 
		society disciplines itself.
		
	The function and etiology of religion like this remains perplexing to me, but 
	as a method of egalitarian coercion, it does at least explain incidents like the
	Pirahã ordering Everett to stop preaching about Jesus because the spirit of 
	Jesus was causing trouble in another village and trying to rape their women with
	his three-foot long penis.	
	
Their weak grasp on personal identity:

	Any random thing can be a ‘spirit’, with regular theatrical performances of 
	‘spirits’ who are obviously tribe men (but when asked, Pirahã deny that there
	is any connection between particular men and spirits, part of their weak grasp
	on personal identity (I was particularly amused by the Heraclitean tone of one
	anecdote: “Pirahãs occasionally talked about me, when I emerged from the river
	in the evenings after my bath. I heard them ask one another, ‘Is this the same
	one who entered the river or is it kapioxiai [a dangerous spirit]?’”), where 
	names change regularly and are considered new people).
	
How they've lowered their expectations so much the jungle seems like paradise to them -- ft. Gwern's memorable "a cross between bonobos and Chimpanzees with wireheading thrown in to boot" analogy for them:

	Living by the plentiful river, with no native technology more advanced than
	a bow, the Pirahã have lowered their expectations to the point where the 
	jungle is paradise. If there is no food, then it is an opportunity to “harden”
	themselves and practice self-reliance. (This is deliberate, as it’s unlikely
	that if it was just the random chance of hunting, they would be so uniformly 
	100-125 pounds & 5-5.3 feet tall). The climate means they don’t need much 
	clothing or shelter, and if it’s raining, they can make a primitive hut. If
	they are hungry, they can go into the jungle and hunt. If there are foreigners,
	they can beg for food. They amuse themselves by talking and dancing and having
	sex and hunting and fishing and being self-reliant. They have no worries most 
	of the time, have few duties - even child-rearing is easy, as women give birth
	with little ceremony and die by themselves, the Pirahã are willing to euthanize 
	inconvenient infants, and much like the child-rearing practices described by 
	Jared Diamond, children are expected to injure themselves and learn - and are 
	happy. Reading about them, they come off as a cross between bonobos and 
	Chimpanzees with wireheading thrown in to boot.
	
Gwern is astonished as to how the Pirahã ever came to be in the first place, feeling that "culture" isn't sufficiently explanatory, and appealing to gene-environment co-evolution instead:

	I might believe in culture as an explanation, with the Pirahã being just the
	most extremely conservative surviving culture, if the claims were not so 
	extreme. But can that really be the case?

	Can we really appeal to culture as the explanation for why not a single Pirahã
	is literate, or can count, or has left the tribe to earn money, or brought a 
	non-Pirahã woman in as wife, or total cultural stasis for at least 300 years, 
	and all of the other singularities Everett claims? Is this the case for any
	other tribe ever, even the ones considered by their neighbors as the most
	primitive and least intelligent, like the Pygmies, or cases of cultural 
	regression like the Tasmanians? Have the Amish ever succeeded in having an 
	attrition rate <5%, and that with a relative level of wealth to the surrounding
	America far closer than the Pirahã relative to Brazilian? Why are all the other
	groups like the Warlpiri of Australia able to borrow numbers when numeral systems
	become useful, except the Pirahã? The Pirahã have been trading with Brazilians
	for at least two centuries, and have not taken any steps toward it. The endogamy
	and linguistic isolation is surprising; they seem more endogamous than the 
	Bushmen, whose lineage may have diverged scores of thousands of years ago, or the
	castes of India. They have, for all anyone knows, been separate for thousands of
	years... This alone, along with their small population (both present and 
	presumably founding), could yield major genetic drift on many traits.
	
	On the other hand, gene-environment co-evolution would make tremendous sense; 
	over millennia of reproductive isolation and specialization to their ecological
	niche, Pirahã have reached a local optimum where abstraction and planning are
	unnecessary and only lead to trouble and the potential for inequality, and either
	punishment or simply lack of additional fitness for such cognitive traits, which
	was continuously reinforced by natural & sexual selection over hundreds of
	generations (evolution does not stop at the neck), leading to a population many SDs
	from surrounding populations. (“I would go so far as to suggest that the Pirahãs 
	are happier, fitter, and better adjusted to their environment than any Christian or 
	other religious person I have ever known.” Indeed.) This would be similar to 
	Harpending & Cochran 2015’s model of the Amish. This parsimoniously explains the
	observations without the need for backflips in interpretation of many anecdotes.
	
They're embarrassed by what they don't know/have forgotten, and try to hide	it:

	If the Pirahã culture is so extraordinarily conservative, why did they eagerly learn
	to make canoes that they prize highly, saying that Pirahã canoes are bad, and only 5
	days later decide it was a bad idea? But Everett gives us a valuable clue in a 
	different anecdote:

		…I was surprised that the Pirahãs did not seem tired at all, however. 
		In the village the Pirahã men avoided carrying heavy things. When I 
		asked them for help in carrying boxes or barrels and such, they were 
		always reluctant to respond. When they did help, they could barely lift
		things that I could carry with ease. I had just assumed that they were
		weak and lacked endurance. But I was wrong. They didn’t normally carry
		foreign objects and they didn’t like to display their ignorance of how 
		to handle them.

	Like anyone else, they are embarrassed by what they don’t know - or have forgotten - 
	and when asked, will make up excuses or dodge it some other way. Similarly, the failure
	to teach counting does not require some sort of subtle Pirahã ploy where they pretend
	to be interested and to learn how to count for very practical reasons and then sabotage
	it to comply with the dictates of Pirahã culture; it was simply that difficult, and any
	teacher will be familiar with students on whom instructions are writ on water. 
	Supposedly a school was opened in 2012, so it would be interesting to hear whether a 
	Potemkin school (recent events doubtless having reminded everyone that the Brazilian 
	government has its fair share of problems with corruption & incompetence), what fraction
	ever enroll, how much attrition there is, and what performance levels any are able to reach.
