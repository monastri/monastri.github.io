## What is this?

This is the "business, finance, entrepreneurship and management" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building.

### Data content loops
([overview](#overview)) 

First came across this in Kevin Kwok's essay [Making uncommon knowledge common](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/), where he tries to figure out Rich Barton's playbook for repeated success in founding unicorns in consumer tech (three to be exact, unheard of among founders). 

Kevin first hypes up Rich:

```markdown
When Michael Jordan returned to basketball from retirement—the first time, in 
his prime, not the second time of which we do not speak—the whole world watched
in awe. Meanwhile, the tech world just saw the return of arguably the GOAT of 
consumer tech, the founder of three household names in Expedia, Glassdoor, and 
Zillow. And hardly anyone, even inside Silicon Valley itself, paid it any mind.

Rich Barton is hardly a household name. Perhaps this is because he’s not based 
here, and makes relatively few investments. However, while there are more visible
founders (like Bezos and Zuckerberg) who’ve built bigger businesses, market cap 
and notoriety aren’t the only measures of a founder. And Barton is a strong 
contender for the title of best consumer tech founder because of his repeated
success. He’s founded three consumer companies each worth over a billion dollars
with Expedia ($18.6B), Zillow ($8.8B), and Glassdoor (Said to have been acquired
for $1.6B).

Repeatable success is key, especially in Consumer tech which is one of the hardest
areas to succeed in. Companies that sell to large Enterprise customers are 
relatively well understood now, and even our understanding of SaaS metrics and 
business model decisions has matured a lot over the last decade. The Consumer tech
sector, however, remains dark magic. The playbooks are far less developed—and no 
one’s playbook has demonstrated the repeatability of Rich Barton’s.
```

Then the claim:

```markdown
Rich Barton’s companies all became household names by following a common playbook.

The Rich Barton Playbook is building Data Content Loops to disintermediate
incumbents and dominate Search. And then using this traction to own demand in their 
industries.

Or as he puts it “Power to the People”.
```

Do you get it? Me neither. 

Let's soldier on anyway. *Why* data loops? 

```markdown
Owning demand gives companies a compounding advantage, but needs to be bootstrapped.
When a company is just starting out, it not only doesn’t own demand, it has all the 
disadvantages of competing against others that do.

In order to grow their demand high enough to become a beneficial flywheel, Barton’s 
companies use a Data Content Loop to bootstrap their demand and create unique content
and index an industry online (homes for Zillow, hotels and flights for Expedia, 
companies for Glassdoor).

- Expedia: Prices for flights and hotels that before you’d have to get from travel agent
- Zillow: Zestimate of what your house is likely worth that before you’d have to get from
broker
- Glassdoor: Reviews from employees about what a company is like that before you’d have 
to get from a recruiter or the company itself

These Data Content Loops help the companies reach the scale where other loops like SEO,
brand, and network effects can kick in.

Barton’s companies then use this content to own search for their market. This gives them
a durable and strong source of free user acquisition, which enables them to own demand.
```

Per Thiel: you want to be a monopoly. 

Where does the industry disintermediation thing happen? Via the whole "power to the people" thing/"data content loops":

```markdown
His companies take power from the incumbents and give it to consumers. Instead of trying
to hoard information, they are on the side of consumers and giving them more data 
transparency.

Glassdoor revealed how employees really felt about companies. Zillow shed light on what 
any house was worth. Expedia let people see the prices and availability of flights and 
hotels without talking to an agent. 

These were knowable things that people have always talked about with each other. There 
are few topics adults love gossiping about more than work, real estate, or travel. And 
few categories as core to their net worth.

Rich Barton took these whispered conversations and made them public for everyone to see.
Afterwards, everyone wondered why they were ever private.

Part of the reason was that companies benefited from this credibility through obscurity.
Real estate brokers have access to significantly more data about the specific houses and 
the general market via a set of data sources called the MLS. Historically, only brokers 
had access to MLS data, which gave them leverage over their customers and entrenched 
their importance as market makers. 

Similarly, lack of visibility into companies allowed bad ones to put on a good face until
prospective employees had already joined. And only large companies could pay for data 
from compensation research providers, giving them advantage over the potential hires they
negotiated with. Many incumbents are able to intermediate their markets and unfairly gain
an edge from people’s lack of knowledge. And it’s scary to be the first to buck this trend
on your own.

Plus it is logistically difficult. Job applicants are unlikely to know a current employee 
at companies they are considering joining. And even if they did, it’s unlikely they could 
trust them to tell them the unvarnished truth. Employees have little incentive to say
negative things about their employer, unless very close with the person asking.
```

Kevin calls this a "sparse commons", and notes that it's a classic example of "natural market failure". Rich, claims Kevin, is solving this problem with his companies:

```markdown
While some incumbents take advantage of the information asymmetry, most benefit from a third party that will handle the logistics things like:

- Verifying legitimacy of information being shared
- Maintaining privacy of participants
- Aligning incentives to get people to participate in contributing to the commons
- Finding, ingesting, and curating third party data into the commons

Rich Barton’s companies became public Schelling Points. They create common knowledge in 
their industries from information only middlemen had access to before, from public-but-
hard to aggregate data, or from information collected from users themselves. These 
intermediaries, whether brokers or travel agents were misaligned. They controlled what 
information was shared with the public, but has an interest in withholding it. Instead of
pushing increasingly more and higher quality information to the public, they maintained
the status quo.

Creating common knowledge creates a network effect. All companies in Silicon Valley want
to build network effects, but few have followed Barton’s path despite its effectiveness.
The more people use and trust Glassdoor, the more companies must take it seriously. And 
as users see more people contributing to Glassdoor, they can be more confident they’ll 
stay anonymous when they add their review. There are virtuous loops in common knowledge.
```

So apparently Rich's secret is creating Schelling points of common knowledge ("I know that you know" as an improvement over just "I know" and "you know" separately, because enables coordination) to create network effects. 

Aggressive focus on search as acquisition channel + first-mover advantage:

```markdown
All of Rich Barton’s companies have primarily used Search (and word of mouth) as their
acquisition channel. Search is a great channel, since it can drive significant demand
at low cost. Few companies can generate enough high quality web pages about their 
industries to fully capitalize on it, however. 

The Data Content Loops of Barton’s companies let them be the authoritative public 
source on a subject at scale and low cost. By having super relevant information about 
every hotel, home, or company someone might be interested in, Barton’s companies become
the ideal destination for consumers.

Over the years, he’s refined this model. Expedia aggregated all the various hotel and 
travel options, but others had done that as well. However, Expedia and Booking.com were
among the most aggressive to understand the importance of search. If you had the top 
spot in search, the next best thing was to acquire more sites so you owned the next top 
result, and so on. Use Travelocity, Orbitz, CheapTickets, or Hotels.com? All of them are
owned by Expedia. And any site not owned by Expedia is probably owned by Booking.com. 
This approach, coupled with dominating the paid acquisition side as well, helped them 
dominate.

With Zillow and Glassdoor, Barton took this a step further.

Before Zillow and Glassdoor, if you wanted to look up information about a specific home
or company, there wasn’t a webpage for it. Barton’s companies created the definitive page
for each house and company. Using a combination of data from authoritative sources (like
all the various MLS systems) and user-generated data, they created high quality content
unique to each company or listing. Being among the first to do this let them do a huge 
SEO land grab, which has been hard to displace since.

### The value of working in advertising
([overview](#overview)) 

Jeff Kaufman discusses whether [there is value in working in ads](https://www.jefftk.com/p/value-of-working-in-ads?fbclid=IwAR3GaiMu50C4PsQzA_1jFLUoYRIW12ReR5eyvOFGeXJIQs2kkgceT2x9tXI) in response to someone asking him whether he saw the direct impact of his earning-to-give strategy as positive or negative, because he worked in display advertising at Google. 

Jeff agrees that this is a good question:

```markdown
This is a good question, and a common objection to earning to give: you wouldn't
want to take a job that was majorly negative for the world in order to earn a bit
more money to donate. So how is the world different with me doing this job as 
opposed to something else?
```

He thinks the display ads business is "overall positive, despite some downsides", because ads are "a very progressive and democratic way of funding things" that's "invisibly intrusive" (instead of obnoxious visibly intrusive ads):

```markdown
The majority of websites are funded through ads, and this has allowed an enormous
diversity of information to flourish. I can afford to write for fun and run this 
site without ads on it, but many people with interesting things to say can't.
The New York Times can convince some people to pay, but a subscription-only web
would be much worse. Overall, ads are a very progressive and democratic way of
funding things: everyone can read and everyone can write, not just people who can
pay.

On the other hand, it's not ideal. Ads are often annoying, and can get in the way
of what you're trying to read. They can be slow to download or execute and delay
the rest of the page. Similarly, they can download large images or videos using up
your metered data plan. While sometimes ads fill a beneficial function of 
informing you about something you'll honestly be better off from having purchased,
other times they're trying to convince you to spend your money foolishly.

Many people would put ad tracking on this list of downsides: sites pass information
to data brokers that build custom profiles for each user and allow personalizing 
ads. From my perspective, however, while having this information collected seems a
bit creepy, it allows showing ads I'm more likely to be interested in. This makes 
publishers more money than showing untargeted ads, and I'd much rather fund them 
through better ad targeting (invisibly intrusive) than through more obnoxious ads 
(visibly intrusive).
```

This reminds me of Jessica Su's [answer](https://qr.ae/TWTGvh) to "Why does everyone want to work for Google if it is just an advertising company? What is so inspirational about solving complex engineering problems in the advertising space?":

```markdown
I think targeted ads are the coolest thing. They

1. Empower people who would not otherwise be given a voice
2. Connect people with interesting and relevant content
3. Keep the web free for users
4. Directly motivate research in artificial intelligence and machine learning
5. Make the internet smarter and more personalized, and bring us one step closer to 
the sci-fi dream of fully intelligent computers.

Google is one of the world’s best advertising companies, and by improving their
products, you get to directly help billions of people. Who wouldn’t want to help billions 
of people?

### Iron Law of Bureaucracy
([overview](#overview)) 

Jerry Pournelle's [Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html):

```markdown
In any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people:

First, there will be those who are devoted to the *goals* of the organization. 
Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many 
of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some 
agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective 
farming administration.

Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization *itself*. Examples
are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of
education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.

The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep 
control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions 
within the organization.

### Real work and bullshit jobs
([overview](#overview))

From Sarah Constantin's [How much work is real?](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/how-much-work-is-real/).

Productive work:

```markdown
Some work is clearly “productive.” If you plant things in a garden, you put in work,
and you get out plants.  If you cook a meal, your family gets fed. If you build a 
building where people want to live or work, they get shelter. If you treat a patient,
the patient gets better. If you carry goods to the place that they’re sold, people
get their stuff. If you invent a labor-saving machine, people get to free up their 
time for other things.

Productive work creates *value*, in the sense of “doingstuffness”, mana, usefulness-
to-humans, etc. It’s not just effort expended, or an accounting formalism like dollars, 
it’s an increase in the “real wealth” of humanity. That’s not a well-defined concept,
but it’s worth pointing at, so we know what we’re complaining about when we see 
deviations from this.

In the standard capitalist story, you get paid for work because you created value for
somebody; they wanted your stuff so much that they were willing to give you something
in exchange for it.

In this world, all productive work is honorable.  Work is *fair* — on average, you get
what it’s worth — and it’s a contribution, however small, to the wellbeing of
humankind, the fire that beats back against the blackness of hard vacuum.
```

Work that clearly fails to be productive:

```markdown
But there are ways that things called “work” can fail to be productive work.

Fraud or crime obviously are not productive. If you get money from people by tricking 
or terrifying them, you’re not getting it by providing them with value. You’re not a 
*maker*.

Enforced monopoly power is also not entirely productive. If people are required by law
— on pain of punishment — to buy your product, then at least some of your revenue is 
driven by fear, not desire.

Regulations can be a form of enforced monopoly power. If only people who meet certain
criteria are allowed to sell, then people are buying from you and not your competitors
not because they like you better, but because your competitors are driven out by fear
of punishment. Once again, you’re profiting partly off fear, not just desire.

A job that is funded by taxpayer money, or by the fact that the product sold is
mandatory to buy, or by the fact that nobody knows whether it would be illegal to get
rid of that job and they want to play it safe, doesn’t need to be useful at all.
```

Work that can indirectly fail to be productive:

```markdown
And there are still more indirect ways that a job can fail to be useful.  If you sell
to people who don’t do anything useful, then your job would not have been necessary in
a sensibly organized world, even if you do nothing dishonest yourself and genuinely add
value to your customers.

This is what it means to live in a “mixed economy.”  Not everything that everyone does 
for a living is genuinely useful.

If there are bullshit jobs, as anthropologist David Graeber claims, then that’s a shame,
from the perspective of human well-being. If we have enough real wealth, enough mana, to
support even people who aren’t making mana, then why not just allow leisure, instead of 
forcing people to go through the motions of dull and unnecessary work?

This is largely the position of left-libertarians like the people at Center for a
Stateless Society.  They make the empirical claim that most of the present economy in 
developed countries is coercive and unproductive, the result of crony capitalism and 
regulatory capture rather than honest, useful work.  As such, a “freed market” without 
such corruption would actually be more egalitarian than our current economy.   Since 
government promotes monopoly, Big Business wouldn’t be sustainable without coercion.  
Since highly regulated and positional goods like housing and education are essentially 
mandatory for participating in much of modern life, if those mandates were abolished, 
socioeconomic inequality would drop.

On the other hand, this empirical claim could be false. Nobody denies that some corruption
exists, but it might be the exception rather than the rule. We might not, in fact, be in
post-scarcity conditions.  So-called “bullshit” jobs may actually be valuable, just easy
to dismiss by outsiders like Graeber.  Growing wealth inequality may be largely the result
of winner-take-all phenomena, as Tyler Cowen thinks — in his model, the working rich 
really are more productive than ever, thanks to the amplifying effects of technology.  
Love it or hate it, says Cowen, capitalism works the way it says on the tin.
```

I was surprised by this particular example, and would like to know if the result replicates(?):

```markdown
Matt Rognlie’s paper shows that the long-term rise of capital’s share of wealth (compared
to labor’s) is almost entirely a result of increased housing prices — literal rents, kept
high by land-use restrictions.
```

Add to this Robin Hanson's claim that S&P 500 firms are now "5/6ths dark matter", or hard-to-copy intangibles (illegibles?):

```markdown
Imagine that you wanted to create a new firm to compete with one of these big established
firms. So you wanted to duplicate that firm’s products, employees, buildings, machines, 
land, trucks, etc. You’d hire away some key employees and copy their business process, at
least as much as you could see and were legally allowed to copy.

Forty years ago the cost to copy such a firm was about 5/6 of the total stock price of 
that firm. So 1/6 of that stock price represented the value of things you couldn’t easily
copy, like patents, customer goodwill, employee goodwill, regulator favoritism, and hard 
to see features of company methods and culture. Today it costs only 1/6 of the stock 
price to copy all a firm’s visible items and features that you can legally copy. So today
the other 5/6 of the stock price represents the value of all those things you can’t copy.
```

"Intangibles" isn't just "great culture", as people are wont to default to, it's also patents and rent-seeking favoritism:

```markdown
“Intangibles” would certainly include rent-seeking forms of favoritism.

It also includes patents, which arguably do not increase innovation on the margin 
(according to natural experiments between different countries with different patent regimes
or changes in patent laws.) Copyright and patent lengths have gotten longer in the US, and 
patent applications have grown at an accelerating rate; the growth of intellectual property
is another example of our economy becoming more monopolistic.

Paul Graham, [A student's guide to startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html):

```markdown
The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they need, 
and you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the 
real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole concept of a "good effort" 
is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in nature.

([overview](#overview))

From [Marc Andreessen gives the career advice that nobody wants to hear](https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-whatever-you-do-dont-follow-your-passion-2014-5/?IR=T):

```markdown
"Do what you love" / "Follow your passion" is dangerous and destructive career advice. We tend to hear it 
from (a) Highly successful people who (b) Have become successful doing what they love. The problem is that 
we do NOT hear from people who have failed to become successful by doing what they love. Particularly pernicious 
problem in tournament-style fields with a few big winners lots of losers: media, athletics, startups. Better 
career advice may be "Do what contributes" -- focus on the beneficial value created for other people vs just 
one's own ego. People who contribute the most are often the most satisfied with what they do -- and in fields 
with high renumeration, make the most $. Perhaps difficult advice since requires focus on others vs oneself -- 
perhaps bad fit with endemic narcissism in modern culture? Requires delayed gratification -- may toil for many 
years to get the payoff of contributing value to the world, vs short-term happiness.

<a name="#consultings-value-add"></a>
### Consulting's value-add
([overview](#overview))

Loku cofounder Raj Ramanan's [answer](https://qr.ae/TW1HiJ) to the Quora question 

```markdown
"What value do consulting firms (like McKinsey, Bain, et al.) really add to an 
operation? What exactly is it that they do that commands such premium compensation
and, more importantly, has created an entire sustainable and enduring industry?"
```

is apparently very well-received, including by a number of "top-shelf consultants" from the MBB firms themselves. So:

```markdown
I interned at Bain & Co., started my career at McKinsey & Co, worked in the operations
/turnaround group at KKR with ex-BCG consultants, worked at an internal consulting 
function at Bear Stearns, and was an independent consultant to small and medium
businesses before co-founding a company (Loku).

I first want to make the distinction between generalist strategy consulting shops 
(McKinsey, Bain, and BCG) vs. specialized or technical shops (Accenture, boutiques).
I can only speak credibly about the former (though, as a former consultant, a lack of
credibility has never stopped me from talking on any subject...).

Cynicism aside, the real **value a consulting firm provides is**:

1. **Political leverage**: CEOs that want or need to make an unpopular decision often 
bring in a consulting firm to help. This provides ammunition to recommend an unpopular
or risky decision to the board (expansion into a new business line or geography, or 
shutting down a plant). The CEO can also distance herself from an unpopular decision by
blaming the consultants. Finally, if things go wrong, consultants are a handy scapegoat. 

2. **Pool knowledge across functions**: Consultants are not part of the client's culture,
politics, or org culture. In the first month, as the firm builds a fact base, consultants 
usually interview people across functions. In large companies, cross-functional problem-
solving rarely happens. Just getting different functions in a room typically unlocks
creative problem solving.

3. **Pool knowledge across levels**: Similarly, consultants interview, watch, and tag
along with people down the org structure, often starting with customers and moving through
sales and line roles. CEOs and the exec team of large companies rarely do this (exception
being their largest customers). There are tremendous insights to be had by doing this.

4. **Deep focus on one problem**: The biggest value is that you have a dedicated team of
pretty smart people who are generally unbiased that can focus deeply on one particular 
problem. At a company, in any role, you have a day job and at best can focus only a 
portion of your time on a particular issue. Nowhere is this more true than at a startup, 
but that's another Quora post.

I want to point out that even though you could group all of this as "telling you what you
already know," all of this is real value that impacts the bottom line however you measure 
it, and that in the absence of strong leadership or a big, risky culture change, could not
have been accomplished without the consultant.

**What value does a consulting firm NOT provide?**

1. **Subject matter expertise**: The people who are doing the bulk of the work are fresh
out of college (like I was) or business school, often from a range of majors, with little-
to-no work experience. They don't know anything. They are really smart and very hard-
working and resourceful and well-trained, but they know absolutely nothing coming in about
your industry, company, or particular issue. More interestingly, the director or partner
on the project is not really a subject matter expert either. She has built her career in
a particular industry or practice area and has served a range of clients across a range
of problems. Her value is pattern recognition, but there is no way she can know more about
the client's industry, company, or problem then someone who lives it every single day for
years. And most partners and directors are career consultants, not industry vets (certainly
true at the big 3 shops).

2. **Executive coaching**: The firms love to provide long-term, ongoing, ambiguous projects 
on a retainer. If you are a CEO, get a therapist. Or some friends. Or a board that is 
actually helpful. Or a best friend. You don't want a partner at a firm who spends a half
hour a month thinking about you or your problem to bill you on a retainer. 

3. **Actual decision making**: Consultants are great at assembling facts from the outside 
world, bringing in perspective from all functions and levels of your company, finding
interesting patterns, and providing you with a point of view. They will jump in the line of
fire on controversial decisions and fall on the sword if things go wrong. But they can never
actually make the tough decision. No outsider can every truly understand the needs of the 
various stakeholders. No outsider has as much at stake personally and professionally. It is
so incredibly different to recommend layoffs for 10% of a plant (100 people) vs. actually 
firing a single person. I've done both and the former does not have the emotional or 
cultural consequences of the latter. Only the CEO or other leader at a company can actually
pull the trigger; the consultant can at best show you how to hold the gun and maybe give you
a few targets to aim at.


Would I ever hire a consultant?

I believe good leadership (promoting cross-functional decision-making, a flat or open org
structure, autonomy across roles; spending time with customers, talking to folks on the 
front line; and all the other stuff HBR publishes) can provide much more value than hiring 
an outside consultant can.

But, if I could do the following, in certain cases, I would hire a consultant:

1. **Impose limits**: Make sure it is a defined, narrow problem well before the consultants 
show up. Make sure it's a project of defined length, with a defined number and type of 
resource. Demand frequent updates and check-ins. Have the option of aborting the project if
you are not getting what you want or if the directional answer is good enough.

2. **Use a bid process**: The big 3 will lecture you and their individual differences and 
when I interviewed at the firms, I was obsessed about what made them different. They are the
same. They hire from the same talent pool. They are interchangeable. Put them through a 
competitive bid process (sealed bid or auction), with pre-set milestones. They will hate this.
They will tell you that they don't participate in auctions. They will try to wiggle out by 
defining the problem differently or changing the milestones or taking you out to dinner. Don't
do it. Force the process. They will comply. I've done it myself by sourcing consulting services
on behalf of Bear Stearns.

3. **Demand partner time**: It's your (or really your investors' or shareholders') money and
you are paying a fixed monthly fee. Demand partner time. Earlier objections notwithstanding,
I'd rather spend time with someone with 10 or 20 years of consulting experience who has at
least seen my problem in a different industry or knows anything about my industry than a 22 
year old with a fresh diploma who has never actually made a business decision. I know because
I was that kid. Best of intentions and a killer work ethic, but I'd want partner time.

I have a ton of respect for the firms I worked at and the colleagues I worked with. I learned 
a tremendous amount and made lifelong friends. Consulting as an industry and these three firms
in particular provide real business value; companies just need to know how to appropriately 
use these service providers.

### Radical candor is the core competency of the modern manager
([overview](#overview)) 

From Venkat Rao's [Unbundling the manager](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&id=e279695949).

Big claim: 

```markdown
The radically candid manager is in a sense the *last* manager: the core role that
has emerged as the enduring one, after four decades of brutal unbundling of 
management as a function. Organizations that recognize this manage to combine
the efficiencies that result from unbundling the manager with deep and growing
reserves of internal cultural capital and effectiveness. Those that don't end 
up as toxic shitshows of the sort we've seen revealed at Uber over the last 
couple of weeks. So this is actually important, makes-or-breaks-the-organization 
stuff.
```

A bit of historical context:

```markdown
3/ The middle manager -- somebody who manages other managers, but isn't the owner/leader or CEO -- is the sine qua non of the no-skin-in-the-game industrial age ethos.

4/ They do not bear responsibility either for the work getting done, or for the ultimate aims of the organization being attained. That does not mean, however, that they are useless.

5/ The middle manager evolved to occupy a niche: providing a lot of middleware support and coordination required in large-scale organizations.

7/ Many of the pathologies of hierarchical command-and-control organizations arise not from the structure itself, but from the existence of unaccountable middle layers.

8/ Unlike the bottom layers with direct responsibility for getting work done, middle layers are not responsible for immediate consequences.

9/ Unlike the top layers, with accountability to stakeholders and overall organizational performance, middle layers are not responsible for ultimate consequences.

10/ This is a structural position rife with moral hazard. There is a principal-agent problem/no-skin-in-game issue in relation to both the top and bottom of the pyramid.

11/ But the role has not always been vacuous, even though it often is now. A lot of routine logistics, information dissemination, and large-scale coordination used to depend on it.
```

And then times changed:

```markdown
6/ That niche, however, began shrinking in the late 70s. Since that time, a gradual process of unbundling middle-management functions has been underway.

12/ Over the last 40 years, a great many middle-management functions have been refactored into other functions, automated, outsourced, or simply done away with.

13/ You can think of four broad phases, each taking about ten years, and each concerned with a core unbundling principle: 
- autonomy
- efficiency
- innovation
- empathy. 

13/ You can read about the autonomy phase (1975-85)  in books like Tom Peters' Thriving on Chaos, which was the first management book I read as a teenager.

14/ Much of what he wrote about the era of "flattening" organizations is conventional wisdom today, but back then the core idea seemed really radical: trust the individual.

15/ The result of that early era was simply fewer managers, in fewer layers, and most importantly, more autonomous individual contributors, at least at skilled levels.

16/ Peters' ideas came out of a long tradition of people arguing that workers could be trusted rather than treated like convicted felons. McGregor's Theory X/Theory Y (1960s) was an early part of it.

17/ After autonomy, the focus shifted to efficiency (1985-95). This led to the global spread of Japanese ideas, with much of the impact being on the factory floor.

18/ The impact on managers -- a focus on process discipline, monitoring and feedback, is captured in Andy Grove's classic High Output Management (1983).

19/ Autonomy+efficiency in an environment of deregulation and computerization meant "bad management" was solved in a specific way: elimination, automation and outsourcing.

20/ Many middle-managerial functions such as signing off on routine paperwork or disseminating information, were simply computerized or networked away.

21/ Other functions were downcycled: it was recognized that many functions weren't really "management" work, and outsourced to lower-cost non-manager workers, often in other countries.

22/ Matrix management, value-chain optimization, and process re-engineering marked the later stages of this era: broadly, the era of process discipline.

23/ Process discipline helped cleave line management from project/program management, shrink the former (absorbed into "staff" functions in many cases), and frame the latter in "core competency" terms.

24/ In the early 90s, line management functions shrank through unbundling, abandonment, automation and outsourcing, while project/program management functions grew in importance.

25/ Managers began to be held accountable for end-to-end value addition rather than just the internal silo-functioning metrics, setting the stage for the "innovation" era.

26/ By 1995 the stage was set for the "innovation" phase. Fueled by books such as The Innovator's Dilemma (1997), the surviving middle managers turned into risk managers.

27/ The timing was perfect, since the rise of the Internet shifted the entire economy into an innovate-or-die/software-eating-the-world gear. 

28/ Middle managers became like VCs or angel investors, stewarding agendas defined by "porftolios" of "strategic" projects with varied risk profiles and "ROI" expectations.

29/ This 30 year/three phase drive towards increasing individual autonomy, efficiency, and innovation focus utterly transformed the staid middle manager of the 1970s.

30/ Before they were paternalistic types, taking it easy in low-stress robotic functions, insulated from harsh incentives, growing little siloed fiefdoms within safe "job descriptions"

31/ After, they were anxious, ambitious, hungry and stressed risk managers, shepherding a dozen "value-adding strategic initiatives" through brutally Darwinian internal ecosystems.

32/ Obedient, docile employees turned into autonomous, authority-challenging nightmares for bosses who might jump or be reassigned to competing projects anytime.

33/ Autonomy meant that what used to be "rank insubordination" was now "effectiveness." In an environment of competing internal projects, loyalties became  uncertain.

34/ Efficiency meant that scrutiny of costs and performance turned brutal (if not always particularly effective). Except on Wall Street, work stopped being a bacchanalian party.

35/ The focus on innovation meant the static peacetime construct of "job description" transformed into constant maneuvering against shifting internal/external competition. 

36/ Instead of attracting admiration and envy, bragging about the size of your organization  attracted unwanted disruptive innovation from both internal and external competitors.

37/ Chet Richards' Certain to Win (another top recommendation of mine that I use all the time), captures this last management-as-innovation-maneuvering aspect.
```

What was sacrificed in the process?

```markdown
39/ Like many Gen Xers in their early 40s, I am a product of the first three phases, spanning 30 years, of the long-term unbundling of the manager.  

40/ Thinking in terms of autonomy, efficiency and innovation is so instinctively natural for me, and distaste for the 70s fat-cat managers so ingrained, I can't think any other way.

41/ Which means this "native" way of thinking comes with some big blindspots I share with others of my generation, which 70s-era managers would have recognized.

42/ The biggest blindspot has to do with the role of caring in management. This is where Kim's challenge directly versus care personally 2x2 comes in.

43/ Pre-80s managers could be paternalistic in the sense of caring, in part because the overall inefficiency and conflict-averse consensus culture of the economy made it cheap to care.

44/ So 1970s style managerial caring was usually not accompanied by candor and direct challenging. Workplaces were dominantly in Kim's top-left quadrant: ruinous empathy.

45/ The effect of the first three phases of the unbundling of managers was that a lot of managers, if they survived at all, shifted into one of the two lower quadrants.

46/ Many shifted into manipulative insincerity, looking out for themselves at the expense of others, in the classic 1980s-douchebag mode, now a cultural trope.

47/ Many shifted into obnoxious aggression, turning into stress-inducing internal cancers, short-term effectiveness being paid for with long-term damage.

48/ After 30 years of unbundling the manager, a lot of the behavioral mass concentrated in "ruinous empathy" got redistributed into these other two quadrants, even as it shrank.

49/ The result, on the eve of the crash of 2008, was a corporate world with a deep deficit of caring, with or without strong cultures of truth-telling. Then the crash happened.

50/ A big part of the Great Recession was that "caring debt" had come due. We were paying the costs of an economy based on manipulative insincerity and obnoxious aggression.

51/ These are not the same as an economy or company grounded in truth-telling. It is just a culture of the strong exploiting the weak while being indifferent to the truth or effectiveness.

52/ The public sector was no better. The parts gutted by deregulation succumbed to the same pathologies as the private sector. The left-behind part doubled down on ruinous empathy.

53/ Silicon Valley was not immune to this broader shift. In the valley, people began deluding themselves that nice buffets and beanbag chairs were "culture" and stock options a substitute for "caring."

54/ Across the board, Silicon Valley companies joined the great party of accumulating caring debt, except with nicer perks. 

55/ In society, more broadly, politics too succumbed to the same forces that had created the caring deficit in the private sector.

56/ A party based on ruinous empathy -- the tendency to cloak important truths in "PC" and hypocrisy -- lost to one that specializing in obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity.

57/ What was lost across the board, at all levels from Washington DC to the Uber, poster-child for software eating the world, was a culture of caring without sacrificing truth-telling.

58/  This is not a nice-to-have feature of society. A society can create meaning and be worth living in only if individuals actually sincerely care about each other and show it.

59/ At the same time, a society that lacks candor and the ability to challenge lies directly, is one that lacks the ability to function at a very basic level. 

60/ What can you do about it? Buffets and expensive sweatshirts aren't the answer. The answer is the grounding the key 1:1 relationships of society in radical candor.

62/ If you recognize that the core managerial function left, after all the unbundling, is to simply care personally and challenge directly, you will help build institutions that endure.

### Comfort with uncertainty
([overview](#overview))

Sarah Constantin struggles with whether she wants to get better at management and leadership because of the possibility of losing her self in [Dwelling in possibility](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/dwelling-in-possibility/). There were a few quotes that weren't quite what the essay was about, but that struck me as worth remembering of their own regard for how they're articulated.

```markdown
One of the things I’ve noticed in people who are farther along in business or management
than I am, usually men with a “leaderly” mien, is a certain comfort with uncertainty or 
imperfection.

They can act relaxed even when their personal understanding of a situation is vague, when
the future is uncertain, when the optimal outcome is unlikely.  This doesn’t mean they’re
not motivated to get things done.  But they’re cool with a world in which a lot of things
remain nebulous and unresolved at any given moment.

They’re able to produce low-detail, high-level, positive patter for a general audience. 
They’re able to remain skeptical, expecting that most new ideas won’t work, without 
seeming *sad* about that.

Talking to someone like that, it feels like a smooth layer of butter has been spread over
the world, where everything is pretty much normal and fine most of the time — not a crisis,
not a victory, just normalcy.

Being okay with vagueness seems to be a prerequisite to managing other people — after all,
you can’t know every detail of everyone else’s job.  When I managed people, I struggled
with that a lot. I couldn’t be sure a thing was done right unless I checked it for myself.
I’m pretty good at holding large systems in my head, but eventually organizations defeat 
even the most heroic attempt to micromanage them.

Being okay with uncertainty also seems to be a prerequisite for managing a portfolio of 
anything high-risk and high-reward — investments, sales leads, technologies to adopt, etc.
If you are elated every time an opportunity appears, and dejected every time it doesn’t
work out, you’ll have a very hard time emotionally when dealing with a large volume of such
opportunities. (My husband is a salesman and he’s long since stopped telling me about leads
because I’ll get over-excited about every one of them.) ...

There’s a common thread between this notion, and people like Jonathan Haidt who believe in
worldview diversity and people at the Integral Center who believe that higher human 
developmental stages involve the ability to move fluidly between frames, and who sometimes
connect this to business through books like Tribal Leadership.

All of them share a view that the principled or systematic person — the person who believes
in one truth according to one set of principles — is weaker or less spiritually advanced than
the person who sees things through multiple points of view.

In particular, one idea I picked up from Tribal Leadership is that if you believe a particular
thing *as an individual*, you’ll be a weaker leader, because you’re just saying what you 
personally believe (which is selfish, in a sense, or at least private, and thus taken less 
seriously by others).  The leader has to be not just John Smith but the voice of Acme Corp. 
Expressing your own thoughts (speaking as John Smith) has value coming from an individual 
contributor, but there’s a different, more facilitator-like, skill where you try to encourage 
dialogue or distill a common thread between different people’s views, and encourage teamwork 
and unity — and that’s leadership.

I have definitely seen chillness coexist with strong technical skill; quite a few people with
that relaxed, leaderly affect are also top-notch at engineering or data science.  Accepting 
that some information “lives” in the “collective mind” of a group clearly doesn’t preclude 
knowing some things very well in your own mind and being able to execute well individually.

I’ve even seen a certain kind of chillness coexist with radical commitment. Rick Doblin, the 
founder of MAPS, has been steadily working for forty years on trying to promote research into
the therapeutic use of psychedelics.  He’s a pleasant, mild-mannered family man; despite his 
controversial mission, he seems to bear no ill will to anyone, including the regulators he’s
been trying to persuade to ease up drug restrictions.  He’s willing to collaborate with anyone,
from any perspective or background, if it’ll help psychedelic research.  He’s my role model 
for how someone can be profoundly committed to a cause without being an angry or rigid person.
His way is like water wearing down a stone.

But I definitely have heard people tell me that equanimity cost them something — that they lost
the chance to have a personal perspective and to want things for themselves when they learned 
to see things from all possible angles and be a facilitator for others.  I’ve seen people who 
are very good at sparking “interesting” conversations complain that they have a hard time
connecting personally rather than remaining a third-party observer.
```

Related to the above is what leadership coach Bryan Franklin [talks about](http://bryanfranklin.com/blog/evolving-leadership-through-paradox) w.r.t. "holding a paradox in your mind":

```markdown
Consider the common example of a leader who needs to convince her followers that, while 
the team is experiencing significant challenges and there is a very real risk of failure,
ultimately the team will prevail. There are two ways a lesser leader could falter in this
moment. The first is to simply pander to neg activism: agreeing with everyone’s feeling 
that the current situation is rough or hopeless, without offering any vision, possibility,
or credible plan. This would be a good display of empathy, but it won’t lead anyone to 
change. The second mistake would be to hold the opposite view, that the future is bright 
and the current setbacks are illusory or insignificant. This could be seen superficially 
as inspiring, but more likely it will backfire because it will be dismissed as being 
noncredible and unrelatable to the lived reality of the employees.

A superior leader learns how to hold paradox: to believe, at the same time, that the
situation is dire and hopeful, meeting employees where they’re at, but also convincing them
of the actions they can take that will lead to a brighter future. The evidence is that 
things are bad (anyone denying this will be seen as a Pollyanna); and also, the evidence is
that things are good (anyone denying this would be seen as a weak leader, lacking 
creativity to produce a positive way forward). Followers need to feel met in the reality 
that they are scared, yet they also need to be given a realistic expectation of future 
success.

When you’re confronted with a paradox, you are presented with a choice. You can either 
ignore it and take a side (believe one side of the statement is true while the other is 
false), or you can do what we call hold paradox, which is to believe both contradictory 
statements or implications simultaneously. It’s an expression of faith in a greater truth 
that is currently invisible to you, but resolves the paradox and allows for the truth of 
both sides to harmoniously coexist. This is what great leaders do.

Holding paradox is the ability to literally hold in your mind the truth and acknowledge, 
for example, your utter insignificance on a cosmic scale, and then without allowing that
experience to dissipate, add to it the unmistakable truth of your profound significance 
to those you love.

### High standards
([overview](#overview))

Jeff Bezos' [2017 annual letter to shareholders](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2015-letter-to-shareholders) gives "high standards" as the answer to "how to keep ahead of customers' divine discontent" and talks a bit more about what high standards entail in practice. 

In summary: 

```markdown
The four elements of high standards as we see it: 

they are *teachable*, 
they are *domain specific*, 
you must *recognize* them, and 
you must explicitly coach realistic *scope*.
```

Jeff believes high standards are teachable:

```markdown
First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable? If you 
take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be
taller. Do we first and foremost need to *select* for “high standards” people? If so, this 
letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so. I believe high
standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply 
through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards 
team, and they’ll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those
too will quickly spread. And though exposure works well to teach high standards, I believe 
you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high 
standards, which I hope to share in this letter.
```

Jeff also notes that high standards are domain-specific:

```markdown
Another important question is whether high standards are universal or domain specific. In 
other words, if you have high standards in one area, do you automatically have high standards
elsewhere? I believe high standards are domain specific, and that you have to learn high 
standards separately in every arena of interest. When I started Amazon, I had high standards
on inventing, on customer care, and (thankfully) on hiring. But I didn’t have high standards
on operational process: how to keep fixed problems fixed, how to eliminate defects at the 
root, how to inspect processes, and much more. I had to learn and develop high standards on 
all of that (my colleagues were my tutors).

Understanding this point is important because it keeps you humble. You can consider yourself
a person of high standards *in general* and still have debilitating blind spots. There can 
be whole arenas of endeavor where you may not even *know* that your standards are low or non
-existent, and certainly not world class. It’s critical to be open to that likelihood.
```

It's also important to recognize high standards, and know scope, i.e. realistic expectations for how hard it should be (how much work it will take) to achieve that result -- this isn't as obvious as you may think:

```markdown
First, you have to be able to *recognize* what good looks like in that domain.

A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing handstand. No leaning
against a wall. Not for just a few seconds. Instagram good. She decided to start her journey 
by taking a handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while but wasn’t 
getting the results she wanted. So, she hired a handstand coach. Yes, I know what you’re 
thinking, but evidently this is an actual thing that exists. In the very first lesson, the 
coach gave her some wonderful advice. “Most people,” he said, “think that if they work hard,
they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The reality is that it takes 
about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks,
you’re just going to end up quitting.” Unrealistic beliefs on scope – often hidden and 
undiscussed – kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team,
you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is
going to be – something this coach understood well.
```

"Recognizing high standards" and "scope" also come into play together in Jeff's famous (or infamous) 6-page memos in lieu of PPT slides:

```markdown
We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we 
write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each
meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely.
Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the 
meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.

In the handstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to *recognize* high standards. It 
wouldn’t be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, 
and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. The writing example is very different. The 
difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely 
hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find
that much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they 
see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable.

Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s 
inability to *recognize* the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on *scope*: they
mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even
a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They’re trying to perfect a handstand
in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-
written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of
days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can’t be done in a day or two. The
key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that
a great memo probably should take a week or more.
```

Note that nowhere does Jeff talk about needing "skill" for meeting high standards. He addresses this explicitly w.r.t. the memo writing example:

```markdown
Beyond recognizing the standard and having realistic expectations on scope, how about skill?
Surely to write a world class memo, you have to be an extremely skilled writer? Is it another
required element? In my view, not so much, at least not for the individual in the context of 
teams. The football coach doesn’t need to be able to throw, and a film director doesn’t need 
to be able to act. But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and 
teach realistic expectations on scope. Even in the example of writing a six-page memo, that’s 
teamwork. Someone on the team needs to have the skill, but it doesn’t have to be you. (As a 
side note, by tradition at Amazon, authors’ names never appear on the memos – the memo is 
from the whole team.)
```

Benefits of high standards:

```markdown
1. Naturally and most obviously, you’re going to build better products and services for 
customers – this would be reason enough!

2. Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards – they help with 
recruiting and retention.

3. More subtle: a culture of high standards is protective of all the “invisible” but crucial 
work that goes on in every company. I’m talking about the work that no one sees. The work that
gets done when no one is watching. In a high standards culture, doing that work well is its own
reward – it’s part of what it means to be a professional.

4. And finally, high standards are fun! Once you’ve tasted high standards, there’s no going back.

### Business success measures
([overview](#overview))

From Jeff Bezos' [first annual letter to shareholders](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2017-letter-to-shareholders), way back in the dawn of time (1997, more exactly), where he talks about his "fundamental management and decision-making approach":

```markdown
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the *shareholder value we create
over the long term*. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify
our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful
our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher 
profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested 
capital.

Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of 
the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree 
to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our
brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our 
customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.

Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently
than some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and 
decision-making approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with 
your investment philosophy: 

1. We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.

2. We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership 
considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street 
reactions.

3. We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically,
to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those
that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.

4. We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability
of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not,
and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.

5. When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing
the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.

6. We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent
competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making 
rational long-term leadership investments.

7. We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance
of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.

8. We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital
management. At this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central 
to achieving the potential of our business model.

9. We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue 
to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely
affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think
like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.

We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours,
and we would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.

Jeff's [2016 annual letter to shareholders](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders) has some great quotes about how he resists organizational stasis at Amazon.

Responding to the question "Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?" at a recent all-hands meeting:

```markdown
    Day 2 is stasis. 
    Followed by irrelevance. 
    Followed by excruciating, painful decline. 
    Followed by death. 
    And that is why it is *always* Day 1.
```

The "starter pack" of "essentials for Day 1 defense:

```markdown
Such a question can’t have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, 
and many traps. I don’t know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it: 

- customer obsession
- a skeptical view of proxies
- the eager adoption of external trends
- high-velocity decision making.
```

Or, as Jeff wraps up:

```markdown
So, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too?
Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you?
Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you?
And most important of all, are you delighting customers?
```

Customer obsession matters most by far:

```markdown
There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product
focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more.
But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.

Why? There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: 

Customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy
and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and 
your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever 
asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and
I could give you many such examples.

Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect 
saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best 
creates the conditions where all of that can happen.
```

This mirrors what he said in his very first annual letter:

```markdown
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized
that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers 
something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought
them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6
football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a 
store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the 
shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift
certificates, 1-Click shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and 
recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word
of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for 
the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to 
make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.
```

In the 2017 annual letter, Jeff again echoes this with the "divine discontent" quote (see also [high standards](#high-standards)):

```markdown
One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are
never static — they go up. It’s human nature. We didn’t ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by
being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday’s ‘wow’ quickly
becomes today’s ‘ordinary’. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever
before. It may be because customers have such easy access to more information than ever before —
in only a few seconds and with a couple taps on their phones, customers can read reviews, compare
prices from multiple retailers, see whether something’s in stock, find out how fast it will ship
or be available for pick-up, and more. These examples are from retail, but I sense that the same
customer empowerment phenomenon is happening broadly across everything we do at Amazon and most 
other industries as well. You cannot rest on your laurels in this world. Customers won’t have it.

How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There’s no single way to do it – it’s
a combination of many things. But *high standards* (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are
certainly a big part of it. We’ve had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high
expectations of customers. We’ve also had billions of dollars’ worth of failures along the way. 
```

Specific product examples from Jeff's [previous year's annual letter](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/static-files/f124548c-5d0b-41a6-a670-d85bb191fcec):

```markdown
Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology
companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow. In contrast, 90
to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want. A good example is our new
database engine, Amazon Aurora. Customers have been frustrated by the proprietary nature, high cost, and
licensing terms of traditional, commercial-grade database providers. And while many companies have started
moving toward more open engines like MySQL and Postgres, they often struggle to get the performance they
need. Customers asked us if we could eliminate that inconvenient trade-off, and that’s why we built Aurora. It
has commercial-grade durability and availability, is fully compatible with MySQL, has up to 5 times better
performance than the typical MySQL implementation, but is 1/10th the price of the traditional, commercial-grade
database engines. This has struck a resonant chord with customers, and Aurora is the fastest-growing service in
the history of AWS. Nearly this same story could be told about Redshift, our managed data warehouse service,
which is the second fastest growing service in AWS history – both small and large companies are moving their
data warehouses to Redshift.

Our approach to pricing is also driven by our customer-centric culture – we’ve dropped prices 51 times, in
many cases before there was any competitive pressure to do so. In addition to price reductions, we’ve also
continued to launch new lower cost services like Aurora, Redshift, QuickSight (our new Business Intelligence
service), EC2 Container Service (our new compute container service), and Lambda (our pioneering server-less
computing capability), while extending our services to offer a range of highly cost-effective options for running
just about every type of application or IT use case imaginable. We even roll out and continuously improve
services like Trusted Advisor, which alerts customers when they can save money – resulting in hundreds of
millions of dollars in savings for our customers. I’m pretty sure we’re the only IT vendor telling customers how
to stop spending money with us
```

The part where you experiment and accept failures and plant seeds etc in the first quote isn't just talk -- Brad Stone covers it in great detail w.r.t. how Prime was created in his 2013 book *The Everything Store*. Again Jeff also covers it in the [previous year's annual letter](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/static-files/f124548c-5d0b-41a6-a670-d85bb191fcec):

```markdown
One area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure. I believe we are the best 
place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are 
inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s 
going to work, it’s not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention,
but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there. 
Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom
is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet 
every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all know that if you
swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a lot, but you’re also going to hit some home 
runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated 
outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most 
runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, 
you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be 
bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.

AWS, Marketplace and Prime are all examples of bold bets at Amazon that worked, and we’re 
fortunate to have those three big pillars. They have helped us grow into a large company, and 
there are certain things that only large companies can do. With a tip of the hat to our Seattle 
neighbors, no matter how good an entrepreneur you are, you’re not going to build an all-composite 
787 in your garage startup – not one you’d want to fly in anyway. Used well, our scale enables us 
to build services for customers that we could otherwise never even contemplate. But also, if we’re 
not vigilant and thoughtful, size could slow us down and diminish our inventiveness.
```

This segues naturally into Ben Thompson's article [Divine Discontent: Disruption’s Antidote](https://stratechery.com/2018/divine-discontent-disruptions-antidote/). There are two advantages to this obsessive customer focus, argues Ben:

```markdown
Critically, when it comes to Internet-based services, this customer focus does not come at the 
expense of a focus on infrastructure or distribution or suppliers: while those were the means to
customers in the analog world, in the online world controlling the customer relationship gives a
company power over its suppliers, the capital to build out infrastructure, and control over 
distribution. Bezos is not so much choosing to prioritize customers insomuch as he has unlocked the
key to controlling value chains in an era of aggregation.

Bezos’s letter, though, reveals another advantage of focusing on customers: it makes it impossible 
to overshoot. When I wrote that piece five years ago, I was thinking of the opportunity provided by
a focus on the user experience as if it were an asymptote: one could get ever closer to the ultimate
user experience, but never achieve it. ...

In fact, though, consumer expectations are not static: they are, as Bezos’ memorably states, 
“divinely discontent”. What is amazing today is table stakes tomorrow, and, perhaps surprisingly, 
that makes for a tremendous business opportunity: if your company is predicated on delivering the 
best possible experience for consumers, then your company will never achieve its goal.

In the case of Amazon, that this unattainable and ever-changing objective is embedded in the company’s
culture is, in conjunction with the company’s demonstrated ability to spin up new businesses on the 
profits of established ones, a sort of perpetual motion machine; I’m not sure that Amazon will beat 
Apple to $1 trillion, but they surely have the best shot at two.
```

Eugene also quotes Ben above, and [adds](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes) that "you can't overserve on user experience":

```markdown
Pattern recognition is the default operation mode of much of Silicon Valley and other fields, but
it is almost always, by its very nature, backwards-looking. One can hardly blame most people for
resorting to it because it's a way of minimizing blame, and the economic returns of the Valley are
so amplified by the structural advantages of winners that even matching market beta makes for a 
comfortable living.

However, if consumer desires are shifting, it's always just a matter of time before pattern 
recognition leads to an invisible asymptote. One reason startups are often the tip of the spear for
innovation in technology is that they can't rely on market beta to just roll along. Achieving 
product-market fit for them is an existential challenge, and they have no backup plans. Imagine an 
investor who has to achieve alpha to even survive.

You can't overserve on user experience... as a product person, I'd argue, in parallel,
that it is difficult and likely impossible to understand your customer too deeply. Amazon's mission 
to the be the world's most customer-centric company is inherently a long-term strategy because it is
a one with an infinite time scale and no asymptote to its slope.
```

The next most important is to resist managing by proxy -- like process as proxy, or surveys as proxy for customers. This is a direct instance of Goodhart's law, and it's so important I'm thinking of giving it its own subheading, or slotting it under a high-level category called "Goodhart-type failures":

```markdown
As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes
in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.

A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But
if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large 
organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at 
outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a 
junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more 
experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The 
process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process 
own us? In a Day 2 company, you might find it’s the second.

Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – 
something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-five
percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature. That is up from 47% in the
first survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead.

Good inventors and designers *deeply* understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy 
developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages
you’ll find on surveys. They live with the design.

I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand
the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you
find your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity,
play, guts, taste. You won’t find any of it in a survey.
```

The third is to embrace "powerful external trends quickly", because "fighting them is fighting the future; embrace them and you have a tailwind" -- here Jeff focuses on ML+AI in particular:

```markdown
The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. 
If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.

These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they 
can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one
right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe 
with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same
for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder.

At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years
now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon 
Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa,1 our 
cloud-based AI assistant. (We still struggle to keep Echo in stock, despite our best efforts. A
high-quality problem, but a problem. We’re working on it.)

But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives
our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations,
merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much
of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core
operations.

Inside AWS, we’re excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so
organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques.

Using our pre-packaged versions of popular deep learning frameworks running on P2 compute 
instances (optimized for this workload), customers are already developing powerful systems 
ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop yields. And we’ve also made
Amazon’s higher level services available in a convenient form. Amazon Lex (what’s inside Alexa),
Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding, 
speech generation, and image analysis. They can be accessed with simple API calls – no machine 
learning expertise required. Watch this space. Much more to come.
```

The last one is high-velocity decision-making, or what Jeff memorably calls "disagree and commit" -- this is what startups do, but it doesn't scale naturally unless your org design explicitly deals with it:

```markdown
Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly. To
keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, high-velocity 
decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations. The senior team 
at Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high. Speed matters in business
– plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too. We don’t know all the 
answers, but here are some thoughts.

First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, 
two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re
wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter.

Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you
wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way,
you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at
course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going
to be expensive for sure.

Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have
conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, 
“Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By 
the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a 
quick yes.

This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the 
time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: 
debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms 
aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different 
opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it
becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle
would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment.

Note what this example is not: it’s not me thinking to myself “well, these guys are wrong and
missing the point, but this isn’t worth me chasing.” It’s a genuine disagreement of opinion, a
candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere 
commitment to go their way. And given that this team has already brought home 11 Emmys, 6 Golden
Globes, and 3 Oscars, I’m just glad they let me in the room at all!

Fourth, recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately. Sometimes teams
have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of
discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the 
default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina 
carries the decision.

I’ve seen many examples of sincere misalignment at Amazon over the years. When we decided to 
invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages – that
was a big one. Many smart, well-intentioned Amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the 
direction. The big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions, many of which needed to be 
escalated to the senior team.

“You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. 
Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.
```

Jeff expands upon the "never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process" remark above in the previous annual letter, by distinguishing between two types of decisions:

```markdown
There are some subtle traps that even high-performing large organizations can fall into 
as a matter of course, and we’ll have to learn as an institution how to guard against 
them. One common pitfall for large organizations – one that hurts speed and inventiveness 
– is “one-size-fits-all” decision making.

Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors
– and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great 
deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the
other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 
decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re
two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with 
the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2
decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.

As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 
decision-making *process* on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result
of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and 
consequently diminished invention.1 We’ll have to figure out how to fight that tendency.
```

### Dealing with message distortion
([overview](#overview))

Eugene Wei, whose blog [Remains of the Day](https://www.eugenewei.com/) is just great in general, has a post called [Compress to impress](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/5/11/jpeg-your-ideas) (URL: "JPEG your ideas") that pithily captures and expounds on a bunch of stuff I've vaguely thought about and seen elsewhere. 

The main issue:

```markdown
Even with modern communication infrastructure, however, any modern CEO deals with
amplification and distortion issues with any message. Humans learn about this problem 
very early on by playing telephone or operator, or what I just learned is more
canonically known outside the U.S. as Chinese whispers. One person whispers a message 
in another person's ear, and it's passed on down the line to see if the original phrase
can survive intact to the last person in the chain. Generally, errors accumulate along
the way and what makes it to the end is some shockingly defective copy of the original.

Despite learning this lesson early on, most people in leadership positions still 
underestimate just how pervasive this problem is. This is why any manager or executive 
is familiar with how much time they spend on communicating the same things to different
groups in the organization. It feels like it's all you do sometimes, and yet you still
encounter people who feel like they're in the dark.
```

Since Eugene worked at Amazon back in the day, he falls back to [Jeff Bezos](#jeff-bezos) as an example of a CEO who grokked this issue and came up with good ways to deal with it, in the process singling out the core problem of information flow as being what drives organizational design:

```markdown
I suspect that very early on in his career as CEO, Jeff noticed the Chinese whispers 
problem as the company scaled. Anyone who is lucky enough to lead a successful company 
very quickly senses the impossibility of scaling one's own time to all corners of the 
organization, but Jeff was laser focused on the more serious problem that presented, 
that of maintaining consistent strategy in all important decisions, many of which were
made outside his purview each day. At scale, maintaining strategic alignment feels like
an organizational design problem, but much of the impact of organizational design is
centered around how it impacts information flow.

This problem is made more vexing by not just the telephone game issue but by the human 
inability to carry around a whole lot of directives in their minds. Jeff could spend a 
ton of time in All Hands meetings or with his direct reports and other groups inside
Amazon, explaining his thinking in excruciating detail and hoping it sank in, but then 
he'd never have any time to do anything else.
```

I'm reminded of the term "Jeff bots" from Brad Stone's 2013 book *The Everything Store*, an almost compulsively-readable business book if there ever was one. 

How have people traditionally ensured message integrity when transmitted via the lossy media of oral tradition and hierarchical organizations? Distinctive message encoding:

```markdown
One of these is to encode you message in a very distinctive format. There are many 
rhetorical tricks that have stood the test of time, like alliteration or anadiplosis.
Perhaps supreme among these rhetorical forms is verse, especially when it rhymes. Both 
the rhythm and the rhyme (alliteration intentional) allow humans to compress and recall 
a message with greater accuracy than prose.

    Fe fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.
 
It's thought that bards of old could recite epics like Homer's Odyssey entirely from
memory because the stories were in verse form (and through the use of memorization tricks
like memory palaces and visual encoding). I don't know many people who can recite any 
novels from memory, but I've occasionally run across someone who can recite a long poem by 
heart. That's the power of verse.
```

How Jeff encodes his messages distinctively -- Day 1 (more [here](#always-day-1)):

```markdown
I never chatted with Bezos about this, so I don't know if it was an explicit strategy on 
his part, but one of his great strengths as a communicator was the ability to encode the 
most important strategies for Amazon in very concise and memorable forms.

Take one example "Day 1." I don't know when he first said this to the company, but it was 
repeated endlessly all my years at Amazon. It's still Day 1. Jeff has even named one of the
Amazon buildings Day 1. In fact, I bet most of my readers know what Day 1 means, and Jeff 
doesn't even bother explaining what Day 1 is at the start of his letter to shareholders, so 
familiar is it to all followers of the company. Instead, he just jumps straight into talking
about how to fend off Day 2, which he doesn't even need to define because we all can probably
infer it from the structure of his formulation, but he does so anyway.

    Day 2 is stasis. 
    Followed by irrelevance. 
    Followed by excruciating, painful decline. 
    Followed by death. 
    And that is why it is always Day 1.
 
An entire philosophy, packed with ideas, compressed into two words. Day 1.
```

Another example of ideas codifed for maximum recall -- catchy annual themes to remind employees of that year's company goals:

```markdown
Go back even further, and there are dozens of examples of Bezos codifying key ideas for 
maximum recall. For example, every year I was at Amazon had a theme (reminiscent of how 
David Foster Wallace imagined in Infinite Jest that in the future corporate sponsors could
buy the rights to name years). These themes were concise and memorable ways to help 
everyone remember the most important goal of the company that year.

One year, when our primary goal was to grow our revenue and order volume as quickly as
possible to achieve the economies of scale that would capitalize on our high fixed cost
infrastructure investments and put wind into our flywheel, the theme was "Get Big Fast 
Baby." You can argue whether the "baby" at the end was necessary, but I think it's more 
memorable with it than without. Much easier to remember than "Grow revenues 80%" or 
"achieve economies of scale" or something like that.

Another time, as we looked out and saw the $1B revenue milestone approaching, one of Jeff's
chief concerns was whether our company's processes could scale to handle that volume of 
orders without breaking (I'll write another time about the $1B revenue scaling phenomenon). 
To head off any such stumbles, we set aside an entire year at the company for GOHIO. It 
stood for "Getting our house in order".

As the first analyst in the strategic planning group, I produced an order volume projection 
for $1B in revenue and also generated forecasts for other metrics of relevance for every 
group in the company. For example, the customer service department would have to handle a 
higher volume of customer contacts, and the website would have to handle a greater traffic
load.

Every group had that year of GOHIO to figure out how to scale to handle that volume without 
just linearly scaling its headcount and/or spending. If every group were just growing their
headcount and costs linearly with order volume, our business model wouldn't work. The 
exercise was intended to find those processes that would break at such theoretical load and
begin the work of finding where the economies of scale lay. An example was building customer
self-service mechanisms to offload the most common customer service inquiries like printing 
return labels.

I could continue on through the years, but what stands out is that I can recite these from 
memory even now, over a decade later, and so could probably everyone who worked at Amazon 
those years.

Here's a good test of how strategically aligned a company is. Walk up to anyone in the
company in the hallway and ask them if they know what their current top priority or mission 
is. Can they recite it from memory?

What Jeff understood was the power of rhetoric. Time spent coming up with the right words to
package a key concept in a memorable way was time well spent. People fret about what others 
say about them when they're not in the room, but Jeff was solving the issue of getting people 
to say what he'd say when he wasn't in the room.

It was so important to him that we even had company-wide contests to come up with the most 
memorable ways to name our annual themes. One year Jeff announced at an All Hands meeting 
that someone I knew, Barnaby Dorfman, had won the contest. Jeff said the prize was that he'd
buy something off the winner's Amazon wish list, but after pulling Barnaby's wish list up in
front of the whole company on the screen, he said he didn't think any of the items was good 
enough so instead he went over to the product page for image stabilized binoculars from Canon,
retailing for over $1000, and bought those instead.
```

Well-codified ideas need little maintenance. Jeff-relevant:

```markdown
One of the great advantages of identifying and codifying first principles is how little 
maintenance they need. Write once, remember forever. As testament to that, ever year, Bezos
ends his Letter to Shareholders the same way.

As always, I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1.
 
It's his annual mic drop. Shareholders must feel so secure with their Amazon shares. Bezos is
basically saying he figured out some enduring principles when he started his company, and 
they're so universal and stable that he doesn't have much to add some twenty years later
except to point people back at his first letter to shareholders.

Other CEO's and leaders I've encountered are gifted at this as well ("Lean in" "Yes we can" 
"Move fast and break things" "Innovation is saying no to a thousand things" "Just do it" "I 
have a dream") but I gravitate to those from Jeff because I saw them arise from distinct needs
in the moment, and not just for notoriety's sake. As such, it's a strategy applicable to more
than just philosophers and CEO's.

...

There will come a day when you'll come up with some brilliant theory or concept and want 
it to spread and stick. You want to lay claim to that idea. It's then that you'll want to
set aside some time to state it distinctively, even if you're not a gifted rhetorician. A
memorable turn of phrase need not incorporate sophisticated techniques like parataxis or 
polysyndeton. Most everyone in tech is familiar with Marc Andreessen's "software is eating
the world" and Stewart Brand's "information wants to be free." Often mere novelty is enough
to elevate the mundane. You've spent all that time cooking your idea, why not spend an 
extra few moments plating it?

Tyler Cowen named his latest book The Complacent Class. It's a really thought-provoking read,
but the alliteration in the title helps. Now economists everywhere are referring to a broad
set of phenomena by the term "complacent class." It wouldn't be nearly as memorable if called
Complacent People or The Dangers of Self-Satisfaction. Can you name the subtitle of the book?
It's "the self-defeating quest for the American Dream" but no one remembers that part.

Venkatesh Rao once wrote a memorable post about management principles encoded in the American
version of the TV show The Office. Anyone familiar with the post probably remembers it by the
first part of its title: "The Gervais Principle." Very few, I'd suspect, remember the rest of
the title—"Or The Office according to The Office"—though it does employ a clever bit of word 
repetition.

Whatever you think of Hillary Clinton as compared to Donald Trump as Presidential candidates,
I'd venture that more people can recite Trump's mantra—Make America Great Again—than Clinton's.
I don't know if she had a slogan, or if she did I don't remember what it was. Her most
memorable turn of phrase from the campaign trail was probably "then deal me in" at the end of 
a much longer phase, “if fighting for women's healthcare and paid family leave and equal pay is
playing the woman card, then deal me in." It's difficult to think of a phrase more emblematic 
of her problems in articulating what she stood for. The first part of the sentence is long and 
wonky, and I couldn't recall it from memory, and she never followed up on the second enough.

If she'd used it repeatedly in a speech, it could have been a form of epistrophe like Obama's 
"Yes we can" or Martin Luther King's "I have a dream." Imagine if she had an entire speech
where she kept hammering on what other cards she wanted to deal. "If ensuring that everyone in 
the country has an equal opportunity to reasonable healthcare is playing the [?] card then deal
me in. If ensuring everyone in this country has the right to a good education is playing the 
[?] card then deal me in." And so on. But she would only use it once in a while, or once in a 
speech, whereas Obama had entire speeches where he would circle back to "Yes we can" again and 
again. [Maybe there isn't an equivalent to "woman card" that makes this epistrophe scalable but 
the broad point about her weak use of rhetoric holds.]

That's not to say "Make American Great Again" is some slogan for the ages, but it is succinct
and has a loose bit of trochaic meter (MAKE ah-MERIC-uh GREAT a-GAIN) which grants it a sense
of emphatic energy which all political movements need. His supporters compressed it into #MAGA
which became a more liquid shorthand for social media. In general it seems the populist backlash
and the alt-right are stronger at such rhetorical tricks than the Democrats or the left, but 
perhaps it is bred of necessity from being the opposition party?

### Typical route to becoming VC
([overview](#overview))

From VC Jeff Bussgang of Flybridge Capital's [answer to What's the typical route to becoming a VC?](https://qr.ae/TW1ANA):

```markdown
Generally speaking, there are two on-ramps to the VC world.

One is what I’ll call “The Apprentice” model: go to a top college, get a few years of
working experience, go to a top business school, spend a few more years in a start-up
(typically in product marketing/management) and then join a firm in your late 20s/early
30s as an associate or principal and hope to be accepted as a junior partner into the 
partnership after 4-8 years. During that time, you will probably shadow a few of the
partners, join one or two boards and try to learn the trade from the experienced, senior
partners around you.

The challenge with VCs who follow this path is that the lack of deep operating experience
can potentially be viewed negatively by entrepreneurs. Some entrepreneurs ultimately 
conclude these types of VCs “don’t get it” because they’ve never walked in their shoes.
On the other hand, these “Apprentice” VCs are often very successful investors because 
they are incredibly broad in their range of expertise and analytical in their approaches
to selecting new investments.

The second on-ramp is what I’ll call the “ex-founder/MoneyMaker” model: work your way up 
the start-up ladder, become a VC-backed founder, navigate a successful exit or two and then
join one of the VC firms that backed you and with whom you’ve had a chance to build a
relationship (and make money for) over 5-10 years. This on-ramp sometimes begins with a 
“Venture Partner” title before becoming a full General Partner (i.e., the training wheels 
come off and you have your own checkbook, subject to partnership approval).

The challenge with VCs who follow this path is that they can be accused of viewing their 
VC careers as a lifestyle choice – “the back nine” – and never really go through the hard
work, long hours and long years to learn the trade. After all, this is a business where you
fund lifecycles are measured in decades. Although these types of VCs may have deep knowledge
in the particular domain where they had operating experience, they may not have the breadth
or analytical horsepower to productively invest in the fully broad range of opportunities
most general partners require to be successful. On the other hand, these “ex-founder/
MoneyMaker” VCs have great networks of former employees and business partners and an ability 
to bond with the next generation of young entrepreneurs for whom they can serve as valuable
mentors.

Which path is the more successful one? I have no idea – but I do know that numerous aspiring
VCs who can’t credibly follow one of these two paths have slim odds to entering the industry;
in a world where the odds are slim at any rate. And many LPs are looking for partnerships 
that blend the best of both sides into a single, holistic unit.

### Main function of insurance sector in economy
([overview](#overview))

Allen Lobo's [answer to *Do you think insurance is really a waste of money in the long run?*](https://qr.ae/TW1Yi7) is bombastically written rhetoric as usual, so I've edited out the parts where he's flabbergasted at how stupid everyone is, and repeats himself for emphasis (unlike other writers I like, Allen's repetitions get on my nerves). 

```markdown
The primary function of the insurance sector in an economy is not your peace 
of mind.

That is certainly an important thing at the level of the individual consumer.
But it is merely a means to a far more important end.

And that end is the **liquidity of capital in the market.** Because **insurance
multiplies spending power in much the same manner as leverage.** And here’s but
a simple model of how it works.

(You’d hope that people would have learned a very painful lesson in the aftermath
of the 2008 financial crisis about what happens when capital freezes up in the 
economy. When people wondered “Why aren’t consumers and corporations spending all
that money, though they’re sitting on it!”)

...

Say you live in a colony which has a hundred families, each living in their own
house. And of the hundred houses, you know from historical experience that on 
average five of them are severely damaged each year due a combination of whatever
natural/man-made causes. Each house then takes $10,000 to repair. That’s an annual
cost of $50,000 every year. It works out to $500 per house on average per year.

Imagine now that there is no insurance of any kind and each family has to rely on 
charity at best, or just cross their fingers.

What do you think is the first thing which they will do?

**Each one will put aside $10,000 as quickly as they can (if they have any sense).**

Because while they know that there is just a 5% chance of it happening to them in 
any given year, over a twenty year period it will happen once to them (on average). 
So it makes sense to save that up.

But the rub of the deal is that they cannot spend or invest that money anymore, it
has to be kept ready at all times because nobody knows -

1. Which precise houses will be damaged each year.
2. Which houses may be damaged at higher or lower rates than average.

That is $10,000 by a hundred families each - one million dollars in capital.

**Locked down or off-limits for even any medium-term, let alone long-term 
investments.**

Oh and by the way, that’s a best-case scenario.

Remember that some of those homeowners after suffering damage the first time, will
go back to saving $10,000 again because providence does not say to them

“Okay, your house was damaged this year, you’ve had your turn.

You don’t need to worry now for the next 20 years, rest assured that misfortune will
hit only the other ones!”

You can now begin to see how terribly inefficient the system becomes in terms of 
**capital locked down purely based on the unpredictability.**

How on the one hand you will have houses that never get hit in that twenty year 
period but keep $10,000 locked up throughout and then on the other hand households
who get hit more than once in that period and then start setting aside even more 
than $10,000! In the real world, each household will actually set aside more than
$10,000 on average (to account for statistical variance in incidence of damage).

But let’s keep it simple for now to $1 million “under the mattress”.

On the other hand, if each family elects to put $500 each year into a ‘pot’ ($50,000
a year), they can rest assured that any untoward damage will be taken care of for 
the five damaged houses. That’s your “peace of mind” bit. Of course some houses will
get more than they put in (the ones who are damaged multiple times) and some may get
nothing back because they never get damaged. It’s how diversifying risk works.

But more importantly $9,500 is freed up for each family at the start of that 20-year
period and can now be put to use in whatever sense they individually need or want to,
whether that be consumption or investment.

That is effectively $950,000 dollars not extra in the system (that did not change) but
extra flowing around to be allocated to where capital can be put to productive use. 
Like I said, no amount of capital is of any use if it is frozen. 

...

Check out what happens in nations where there isn’t a robust insurance industry. How 
people at all income levels (but especially the middle class) keep as much money as 
they can ‘under the mattress’ metaphorically speaking (i.e. in cash, gold or short-
term liquid investments). That severely hobbles economic growth because there is a 
lot of capital alright but it is all ‘frozen’.

It’s not like those people are acting irrationally. No, it is that the absence of a 
advanced and sophisticated insurance sector forces them to act in a fashion which 
hurts economic growth by freezing capital.

Conversely, even though we don’t think of it as such, a system like the National 
Health Service (NHS) in the U.K. is effectively a health insurance firm. The state
says to the citizens “Pay an extra X% in tax every month and you can rest assured 
that you will be taken care of.” Same with unemployment insurance taxes in places 
like Germany.
```

This needs regulation:

```markdown
It is important not just that insurance fraud be punished severely but that insurers
who cheat their customers or misrepresent their products should be hung out to dry.
Because when people stop trusting that financial institutions will keep their 
promises, they go back to “storing money under the mattress” (as they did in the 
aftermath of 2008).Because if you buy an iPhone and Apple then tries to squirrel out
of their warranty, you can say “Screw them, I’ll buy Samsung from now on.” But if an
insurance company cheats you after you having paid those premiums for all of those 
years, it will financially wreck you!

And also why it is just as important that these institutions not be allowed to play 
around with other people’s money (unless it is that of the ultra-rich who have the
appetite and can afford high risk because that’s not money they’re depending on for
retirement).

That is also why as a man of finance, while I am hardly in favor of excessive 
regulations, it brings my blood to boil when I read of financial institutions
defrauding their customers. Whether that be outright or by soft means like cleverly
disguising the risks of financial instruments. It’s like how most policemen must
feel when they read about corrupt cops.

If the national economy were analogous to the human body, all of the other sectors 
are like individual organs. But the financial sector (retail and investment banks, 
insurance firms, mutual funds and pension funds) is the vascular system.

That is why the tech crash of 2000 stayed localized. Because the contagion was 
largely sequestered. If Amazon went bankrupt tomorrow, you’re not going to have it
rip off and take down entire chunks of the economy. But if AIG or Bank of America 
were to collapse on the other hand? It would send the markets into a complete state
of panic!
```

The answer is necessarily simplified lie-to-children style, but it does make me wonder why all the sophistication when the main function is supposed to be to gain the public's trust so they free up capital so that the market's capital is more liquid. The answer, I suppose, is profit maximization in a competitive and highly regulated industry (price differentiation too perhaps?), but I don't know much more about what the nature of the sophistication is for my speculations to be more than hot air.
