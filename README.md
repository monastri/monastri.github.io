## What's this?

A few analogies: think of it like an "external second brain", a "public Pensieve", a personal wiki *a la* a very rudimentary version of [Garrett Lisi's open notebook](http://deferentialgeometry.org/), a "living document" or "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). 

I'm particulary taken by the following [quote from Tiago](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/), arguing for "outsourcing memorization and recall" to an easily-searchable external centralized digital repository:

```markdown
How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? 
How many insights have you failed to take action on? 
How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?
Where is it when we need it? 

Our brain can only store a few thoughts at any one time. 
Our brain is for *having* ideas, not *storing* them.
```

I'm also mainly inspired by what Gwern says [here](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content):

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

And then there's this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen and Garrett Lisi, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document. 

This is my first experiment in [centralized personal knowledge management](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-memory-cognition-teaching-learning.md#Personal-knowledge-management). The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit sprawled over different blogs and notebooks and Word docs and so on. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. 

(Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook into the separate sections you see below, because [the original single-page notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md) got so big (1.2 million char as of Apr 6, 2019, when that monorepo was last updated) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore. There were several reasons for wanting a single-page notebook: zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; lower activation energy for continuous document-wide organizational refactoring; partitioning makes it just a tad harder to draw cross-domain connections, which is an issue because [trivial inconveniences matter](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/reitXJgJXFzKpdKyd/beware-trivial-inconveniences).)

## Content

The sections below comprise a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. (Form should serve purpose, not straitjacket it.)

I have a special place in my heart for poetry, fiction, and wizardry with the written word. Snippets I've stumbled upon over the years, which I strongly want to keep with me for the rest of my life, can be found [here](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md).
