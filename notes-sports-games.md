## What is this?

This is the "sports and games" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

Found a [Google+ post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/fa.shogi/3aMMKIoYWhQ) by chess GM Larry Kaufman comparing various games in the chess/shogi family, apparently in response to a thread/interest in these comparisons that I can't find. 

His credentials:

```markdown
I am the only person in the world to
have earned a 2400 rating in both chess and shogi,  being an International
Master in the former and an Amateur 5 Dan in the latter. I was once
thought to be the strongest non-oriental player in the U.S. of Shang-chi
(Chinese chess), and have played roughly ten games each of Junk-ki (Korean
chess), Chu-Shogi, and Grand Chess (the modernized version of Capablanca's
10x10 chess), enough to have some feel for the good and bad points of each.
```

Very nice! Okay, so what are some key points to consider in this comparison?

```markdown
In my opinion the key points to consider in comparing the games are the

- frequency of draws in games between masters (less is better, though perhaps
a small percentage of draws may be preferred by some to none at all), 

- rough equality of chances of the two sides

- the importance of memorizing opening theory (less is better), 

- variety of play (a major objection to checkers and some might say to Go), 

- history and tradition (very desirable), 

- game length (not too short or too long, though this is subjective), 

- strategical principles (more are better), and 

- early interaction between the two sides (desirable, as if you can just do
your own thing without looking at the other player's moves, the game lacks interest).
```

On to the comparison then. Chess:

```markdown
Let's start with chess, the most widely played game (geographically) of
the family.  It ranks very highly on history and tradition, game length,
strategical principles, and early interaction.  Unfortunately the draw
percentage is too high (around 50% at high levels), and this is mostly due
to the nature of the game rather than to lack of fighting spirit.  The
chances of the two players are quite unequal, white winning about 5 games
for each 3 won by black at high level.  Memorized opening theory is way too
important at high level, though ideas like shuffle chess could solve this
problem.  Variety of play is not bad but could be much better.  So chess
gets 4 1/2 good grades out of 8.  Shuffle chess would score the same,
gaining a point on memorized theory but losing it back on history and
tradition, of which it has none.
```

Chinese chess and Korean chess:

```markdown
Now consider Chinese chess, the version of chess played by the largest
number of people world-wide, I believe.  It also ranks very highly on
history and tradition, game length, and early interaction.  I'll give it a
medium score on strategical principles (there's plenty of strategy, but less
than chess, I feel).  The draw percentage is perhaps a bit lower than in
chess, but still too high (the restriction of the elephants and ministers to
their own camp is the main reason for the draws, I believe).  The first
player has a substantial edge, though perhaps a bit less than in chess.
Memorized theory is a big problem, as in chess.  Variety of play is about
like in chess.  So I'll give Chinese chess the same 4 1/2 score as chess
got.

Korean chess is a relative of Chinese chess.  It scores a bit lower on
history and tradition, and a bit higher on the memorized theory problem,
with other scores about the same.  Let's also give it 4 1/2.
```

Chu-shogi and larger versions:

```markdown
Okay, how about Chu-shogi, the topic of much discussion on this list.
It certainly has history and tradition, though most of it is lost to us now,
so let's give it 1/2 for this.  I suspect that the percentage of draws among
masters would be very low, though I don't believe there are any masters in
the world now to test this hypothesis.  Similarly I cannot imaging that the
first move could be more than a trivial advantage, perhaps 51-49%.
Memorized opening theory is obviously not a problem; even if it existed, it
is very unlikely that this would ever be a decisive factor in such a complex
and long game.  Variety of play is obviously enormous; in fact I'll only
give it 1/2 credit because the variety of moves of the different promoted
and unpromoted pieces is far more than anyone would ever need to enjoy the
game, and simply serves to lower the standard of play by making it difficult
to ever become proficient with all the different pieces.  Game length is
much longer than most people would consider desirable, though the game is
certainly of playable length.  Early interaction certainly can occur, though
the space between the camps minimizes it, so I'll give Chu half credit here.
As for strategical principles, in my opinion there are not so many here, as
the tactical element seems to dominate the game, but I'll give it half
credit, mostly due to my not being expert enough to say for sure.  So I give
Chu 5 points, the best score so far, with the reservation that one would
have to devote an enormous amount of time to the game to acquire any real
proficiency.  I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, but since I have not
played enough to know the moves of the promoted pieces without reference to
the manual, both my skill and my enjoyment go way down late in the game.

As for the larger relatives of Chu, I must agree with  Colin Adams that
they are clearly less playable than Chu without offsetting advantages, and
so I find the constant discussion of these "games" to be rather silly.  I am
quite in agreement with George Hodges in the opinion that the really large
versions were not really meant to be played at all.  In particular versions
in which pieces demote on promotion would simply be drawish and boring.  Chu
shogi already has too many pieces, probably the reason it died out, so even
larger versions must simply be a joke.
```

Grand chess, the second-best of the lot by Kaufman's lights:

```markdown
As chu is to shogi, Grand chess is to chess.  The larger board and
extra pieces (bishop + knight and rook + knight) add a whole new dimension
to the game.  I'll have to give it a zero for history and tradition (a few
games by Capablanca don't qualify it here).  I believe the draw percentage
would be very low among masters (I haven't had one yet), and the advantage
of first move small enough.  Memorized theory doesn't exist, though it could
become a bit of a problem if the game became popular, so I'll give it 1/2
here.  Variety of play is good, more than chess without reaching the point
of overkill as with Chu, but perhaps still a bit less than I would like, so
I'll give it 3/4.  Game length seems about right to me, a bit more than
chess but nothing like Chu.  Early interaction is the same as in chess, and
the strategical principles should be similar.   So Grand chess, despite its
meager following, scores an amazing 6 1/4 out of 8 on my criteria, by far
the best so far.  It really is an excellent game and deserves a bigger
following.
```

Shogi, the best outright:

```markdown
Now for shogi, as it is currently played by millions of Japanese and a
few thousand Westerners.  History and tradition are there in abundance,
comparable to chess.  The draw % (about 2% in pro play, 1% in amateur) is
minimal (some might argue it's too low!).  The advantage of first move is
minimal (about 52-48%).  Variety of play is nearly ideal (ten piece types,
including promoted rook and bishop, versus six in chess).  Memorized theory
is a big problem, nearly as much as in chess, though the chances of turning
around a bad opening are better in shogi, so I'll give it 1/4 (maybe we need
shuffle-shogi !). Game length is ideal.  Early interaction is adequate,
though a bit less than in chess, so I'll give it 3/4.  Strategic principles
are quite ample, perhaps on a par with chess.  So shogi gets 7  out of 8,
making it clearly the winner of this "competition".

     Shogi is not a perfect game.  Some criticisms include the rather
arbitrary moves of some pieces, the occasional draw due to there being no
good way to start the fight in certain openings, the very unaesthetic need
to resolve impasse games by point count, and the fact that many games begin
with both sides moving into identical fortress formations before any
interaction occurs.  Also the strength of the Left Anaguma castle is felt by
many to be a spoiler in shogi, as for a while it seemed to relegate the
ranging rook openings  to the dustbin of history, though the recent success
of Fujii with his anti-Anaguma system seems to puncture a big hole in that
criticism.  Despite these criticisms, I think the evidence is strong that
shogi is the best game in the entire chess family, and with the risk of
offending Go players (a game which I also play and respect greatly), perhaps
the best game of all.
```

Michael Vaniver adds:

```markdown
Playing shogi is much more fun than playing chess for a novice.  The drop
rule permits one to create the position one wants in many cases, which
means that many tactical themes that occur only rarely in chess can be
"manufactured" using drops in shogi.  I also think that the fact that pawns
cannot capture forward in chess tends to create blockaded positions which
sometimes makes it hard to get any attack going.  What usually seems to
happen in these cases is that pieces get exchanged and before you know it
you're in the endgame.  Thus chess games often become a war of
attrition. This can't happen in shogi, and shogi endgames are vastly more
interesting than chess endgames by any reasonable comparison.

I agree with your assessment from my experience.  I think the only "flaw"
in shogi is the standardization of the openings, and that something like
"shuffle-shogi" will be necessary to keep the game from getting bogged down
by opening theory.  Has anyone played shuffle-shogi?  I must add that most
of what I've read on shogi seems to focus on tactics, giving the idea that
the game is primarily tactical.  I suppose this is true in the endgame, but
it would be interesting to read more about shogi strategy beyond analysis
of the opening.

I haven't played Chu (yet; I'm eager to try), but I find it hard to imagine
that a game played on a 12x12 board with 92 pieces could have less
strategical complexity than chess, played on an 8x8 board.  Perhaps you
could elaborate here?  Wayne Schmittberger has argued that the tactical
complexity of Chu is so great that, in fact, strategy dominates tactics
because it's hard to read many moves deep, and so the important thing for
Chu players is to learn to intuitively assess the merits of a position,
much as Go players have to.

### Game complexity measures
([overview](#overview))

Found an interesting notion of "game depth" by renowned computer scientist and chess IM RJ Lipton in his post [The New Chess World Champion](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/12/28/the-new-chess-world-champion/). First the motivation/appetizer:

```markdown
GM Larry Kaufman and I have had closely similar chess ratings for four decades. However, in
the last game we played he gave me odds of rook and bishop and beat me handily. Then he told 
me that the world champion could probably beat him giving the same odds.

This was not Western chess, where I would be pretty confident of beating anyone given just an
extra bishop. It was Japanese chess, called Shogi. Shogi has no piece with the power of a queen,
and the armies have just one rook and bishop each, so the odds I received were maximal. The main
difference from Western chess is that captured pieces become their taker’s property and can be 
“paratrooped” back into the game. This prevents the odds receiver from winning by attrition 
through exchanges as prevails in chess, and throws upon the leader a burden of attack.

It also makes Shogi *deeper* than chess in a way that can be defined mathematically.
```

Ooh, but what is this? Say more words!

```markdown
Say two players are a "class unit" apart if the stronger expects to score 75% against the
weaker in a match. In chess, this corresponds to a difference of almost exactly 200 points
in the standard Elo rating system. László Mérő, in his 1990 book Ways of Thinking, called 
the number of class units from a typical beginning adult player to the human world champion
the "depth" of a game.

Tic-tac-toe may have a depth of 1: if you assume a beginner knows to block an immediate threat
of three-in-a-row but plays randomly otherwise, then you can score over 75% by taking a corner
when you go first and grifting a few games when you go second. Another school-recess game, 
dots-and-boxes, is evidently deeper. We don’t know its depth for sure because it doesn’t have 
a rating system and championship format like chess does.

Chess ratings in the US go all the way down to the formal floor of 100 among scholastic players,
but I concur with the estimate of Elo 600 for a young-adult beginner by a discussion of Mérő’s 
book which I saw in the 1990s but did not preserve. This gave chess a depth of 11 class units up
to 2800, which was world champion Garry Kasparov’s rating in 1990. If I recall correctly, 
checkers (8x8) and backgammon had depth 10 while bridge tied chess at 11, but Shogi scored 14 and
yet was dwarfed by Japan’s main head game, Go, at 25.
```

Whoa, *seriously*? Go's depth is 25?? 

How this relates to computer players:

```markdown
Although it is coming on 18 years since Deep Blue beat Kasparov, humans are still barely fending
off computers at shogi, while we retain some breathing room at Go. Since depth 14 translates to 
Elo 3400 on the chess scale, while Komodo 8 is scraping 3300 on several chess rating lists, This 
feels about right.

Ten years ago, each doubling of speed was thought to add 50 Elo points to strength. Now the 
estimate is closer to 30. Under the double-in-2-years version of Moore’s Law, using an average of
50 Elo gained per doubling since Kasparov was beaten, one gets 450 Elo over 18 years, which again
checks out.

To be sure, the gains in computer chess have come from better algorithms not just speed, and 
include nonlinear jumps, so Go should not count on a cushion of (25 – 14)*9 = 99 years.
```

Indeed it shouldn't. The post was written in 2014; AlphaGo beat the strongest player in the world only 3-4 years later.

Weakness of this metric:

```markdown
One weakness in the notion of depth is dependence on how contests are aggregated. For tennis, 
should we apply 75% expectation to games, pairs of games, sets, or matches—and how many games 
in a set or sets in a match? 

Another is that any game can be ‘reduced’ to depth 1 by flipping a coin; if heads the game is 
played as-usual; if tails a second coin flip defines the outcome. Then nobody ever has more
than 75% expectation. I regard both as beside the point for most board games, but both become
nontrivial for games like backgammon that involve chance and are played with match stakes.
```
