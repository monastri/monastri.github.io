Keith E. Stanovich, [How to Think Straight About Psychology](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205914128.pdf):

Often a person uses some folk proverb to explain a behavioral event even though, on an earlier occasion, this 
same person used a directly contradictory folk proverb to explain the same type of event. For example, most of 
us have heard or said, “look before you leap.” Now there’s a useful, straightforward bit of behavioral advice—
except that I vaguely remember admonishing on occasion, “he who hesitates is lost.” And “absence makes the heart 
grow fonder” is a pretty clear prediction of an emotional reaction to environmental events. But then what about 
“out of sight, out of mind”? And if “haste makes waste,” why do we sometimes hear that “time waits for no man”? 
How could the saying “two heads are better than one” not be true? Except that “too many cooks spoil the broth.” 
If I think “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” why do I also believe “nothing ventured, nothing gained”? And if 
“opposites attract,” why do “birds of a feather flock together”? I have counseled many students to “never to put 
off until tomorrow what you can do today.” But I hope my last advisee has never heard me say this, because I just 
told him, “cross that bridge when you come to it.”

The enormous appeal of clichés like these is that, taken together as implicit “explanations” of behavior, they 
cannot be refuted. No matter what happens, one of these explanations will be cited to cover it. No wonder we all 
think we are such excellent judges of human behavior and personality. We have an explanation for anything and 
everything that happens. Folk wisdom is cowardly in the sense that it takes no risk that it might be refuted.

That folk wisdom is “after the fact” wisdom, and that it actually is useless in a truly predictive sense, is why 
sociologist Duncan Watts titled one of his books: Everything Is Obvious—Once You Know the Answer (2011). Watts 
discusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in which, over 60 years ago, he was dealing with the common 
criticism that “social science doesn’t tell us anything that we don’t already know.” Lazarsfeld listed a series 
of findings from a massive survey of 600,000 soldiers who had served during World War II; for example, that men 
from rural backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of service than soldiers from city backgrounds. 
People tend to find all of the survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for instance, people tend 
to think it obvious that rural men would have been used to harsher physical conditions and thus would have 
adapted better to the conditions of military life. It is likewise with all of the other findings—people find them 
pretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then reveals his punchline: All of the findings were the opposite of what was originally 
stated. For example, it was actually the case that men from city backgrounds were in better spirits during their 
time of service than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last part of the learning exercise is for people to 
realize how easily they would have explained just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual outcome, people 
tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying that they expected it because city men are used to working 
in crowded conditions and under hierarchical authority. They never realize how easily they would have concocted an 
explanation for exactly the opposite finding.

From [Marc Andreessen gives the career advice that nobody wants to hear](https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-whatever-you-do-dont-follow-your-passion-2014-5/?IR=T):

```markdown
"Do what you love" / "Follow your passion" is dangerous and destructive career advice. We tend to hear it 
from (a) Highly successful people who (b) Have become successful doing what they love. The problem is that 
we do NOT hear from people who have failed to become successful by doing what they love. Particularly pernicious 
problem in tournament-style fields with a few big winners lots of losers: media, athletics, startups. Better 
career advice may be "Do what contributes" -- focus on the beneficial value created for other people vs just 
one's own ego. People who contribute the most are often the most satisfied with what they do -- and in fields 
with high renumeration, make the most $. Perhaps difficult advice since requires focus on others vs oneself -- 
perhaps bad fit with endemic narcissism in modern culture? Requires delayed gratification -- may toil for many 
years to get the payoff of contributing value to the world, vs short-term happiness.

But, there's another problem, and that is the fact that statistical and probabilistic thinking is a real 
damper on "intellectual" conversation. By this, I mean that there are many individuals who wish to make 
inferences about the world based on data which they observe, or offer up general typologies to frame a 
subsequent analysis. These individuals tend to be intelligent and have college degrees. Their discussion 
ranges over topics such as politics, culture and philosophy. But, introduction of questions about the 
moments about the distribution, or skepticism as to the representativeness of their sample, and so on, tends 
to have a chilling affect on the regular flow of discussion. While the average human being engages mostly 
in gossip and interpersonal conversation of some sort, the self-consciously intellectual interject a bit of 
data and abstraction (usually in the form of jargon or pithy quotations) into the mix. But the raison d'etre 
of the intellectual discussion is basically signaling and cuing; in other words, social display. No one 
really cares about the details and attempting to generate a rigorous model is really beside the point. Trying 
to push the N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see in a college essay format) will only elicit eye-rolling 
and irritation.

It's not that clean energy will never happen -- it totally will. It's just that it won't come from a 
wild-haired scientist running out of his basement screaming, "Eureka! I've discovered how to get limitless 
clean energy from common seawater!" Instead, it will come from thousands of scientists publishing unreadable 
studies with titles like "Assessing Effectiveness and Costs of Asymmetrical Methods of Beryllium Containment 
in Gen 4 Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors When Factoring for Cromulence Decay." The world will be saved by a 
series of boring, incremental advances that chip away at those technical challenges one tedious step at a time.

But nobody wants to read about that in their morning Web browsing. We want to read that while we were sleeping, 
some unlikely hero saved the world. Or at least cured cancer.

William T. Powers:

```markdown
One thing I have advocated, without much success, is that children be taught social rules (when they are 
ready) in exactly the same way they are taught and teach each other games. The point is not whether the 
rules are right or wrong. Are the rules of 5-card stud poker or hopscotch right or wrong? It's that we're 
playing a certain game here, and there are rules to this game just as in any other game. If you want to 
be in the game, then you have to learn how to play it. Different groups of people play different games 
(different rules = different game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have to learn the 
games they play. When you develop the levels of understanding above the rule level, you'll be able to 
understand all games, and be able to join in anywhere. You won't be stuck knowing how to play only one game.

My problem with selling this idea is that people tend to think that their game is the only right one. 
In fact, being told that they are playing a game with arbitrary rules is insulting or frightening. They 
want to believe that the rules they know are the ones that everyone ought to play by; they even set 
up systems of punishment and reward to make sure that nobody tries to play a different game. They turn 
the game into something that is deadly serious, and so my idea simply seems frivolous instead of liberating.

Patrick McKenzie, "Some Perspective on the Japan Earthquake":

```markdown
The story of Japanese railways during the earthquake and tsunami is the story of an unceasing drumbeat 
of everything going right [...] The overwhelming response of Japanese engineering to the challenge posed 
by an earthquake larger than any in the last century was to function exactly as designed. Millions of 
people are alive right now because the system worked and the system worked and the system worked.

That this happened was, I say with no hint of exaggeration, one of the triumphs of human civilization. 
Every engineer in this country should be walking a little taller this week. We can’t say that too loudly, 
because it would be inappropriate with folks still missing and many families in mourning, but it doesn’t 
make it any less true.

Bruce Schneier:

```markdown
In our large, anonymous society, it's easy to forget moral and reputational pressures and concentrate on 
legal pressure and security systems. This is a mistake; even though our informal social pressures fade 
into the background, they're still responsible for most of the cooperation in society.

Razib Khan, [Reification is alright by me](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/05/reification-is-alright-by-me/):

```markdown
The categories and classes we construct are simply the semantic sugar which makes the reality go down 
easier. They should never get confused for the reality that is, the reality which we perceive but darkly 
and with biased lenses. The hyper-relativists and subjectivists who are moderately fashionable in some 
humane studies today are correct to point out that science is a human construction and endeavor. Where 
they go wrong is that they are often ignorant of the fact that the orderliness of many facets of nature 
is such that even human ignorance and stupidity can be overcome with adherence to particular methods and 
institutional checks and balances. The predictive power of modern science, giving rise to modern 
engineering, is the proof of its validity. No talk or argumentation is needed. Boot up your computer. 
Drive your car.

Paul Graham, [A student's guide to startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html):

```markdown
The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they need, 
and you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the 
real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole concept of a "good effort" 
is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in nature. 
```

Brandon Watson, [The Success and Failure of Arguments](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2010/09/success-and-failure-of-arguments.html):

```markdown
Sometimes you hear philosophers bemoaning the fact that philosophers tend not to form consensuses 
like certain other disciplines do (sciences in particular). 

But there is no great mystery to this. The sciences reward consensus-forming as long as certain 
procedures are followed: agreements through experimental verification, processes of peer review, etc. 
Philosophy has nothing like this. Philosophers are rewarded for coming up with creative reasons not to 
agree with other people. The whole thrust of professional philosophy is toward inventing ways to regard 
opposing arguments as failure, as long as those ways don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much 
philosophers are interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not structured so as to converge 
on it; it is structured so as to have the maximal possible divergence that can be sustained given common 
conventions. 

We are not trained to find ways to come to agree with each other; we are trained to find ways to 
disagree with each other.

From *Cryptonomicon*, by Neal Stephenson:

```markdown
Your younger nerd takes offense quickly when someone near him begins to utter declarative sentences, 
because he reads into it an assertion that he, the nerd, does not already know the information being 
imparted. 

But your older nerd has more self-confidence, and besides, understands that frequently people need to 
think out loud. 

And highly advanced nerds will furthermore understand that uttering declarative sentences whose contents 
are already known to all present is part of the social process of making conversation and therefore 
should not be construed as aggression under any circumstances.

Hastie Dawes, *Rational Choice in an Uncertain World*, pp. 67-8:

```markdown
A lot of outcomes about which we care deeply are not very predictable. For example, it is not comforting 
to members of a graduate school admissions committee to know that only 23% of the variance in later 
faculty ratings of a student can be predicted by a unit weighting of the student's undergraduate GPA, 
his or her GRE score, and a measure of the student's undergraduate institution selectivity -- but that 
is opposed to 4% based on those committee members' global ratings of the applicant. We want to predict 
outcomes important to us. It is only rational to conclude that if one method (a linear model) does not 
predict well, something else may do better. What is not rational -- in fact, it's irrational -- is to 
conclude that this "something else" necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting 
evidence, is intuitive global judgment.
```

David Friedman, *The Machinery of Freedom*:

```markdown
The person who says, as almost everyone does say, that human life is of infinite value, not to be measured 
in mere material terms, is talking palpable, if popular, nonsense. If he believed that of his own life, he 
would never cross the street, save to visit his doctor or to earn money for things necessary to physical 
survival. He would eat the cheapest, most nutritious food he could find and live in one small room, saving 
his income for frequent visits to the best possible doctors. He would take no risks, consume no luxuries, 
and live a long life. If you call it living. If a man really believed that other people's lives were 
infinitely valuable, he would live like an ascetic, earn as much money as possible, and spend everything 
not absolutely necessary for survival on CARE packets, research into presently incurable diseases, and 
similar charities.

In fact, people who talk about the infinite value of human life do not live in either of these ways. They 
consume far more than they need to support life. They may well have cigarettes in their drawer and a sports 
car in the garage. They recognize in their actions, if not in their words, that physical survival is only 
  one value, albeit a very important one, among many.
```

John Perry, from the introduction to *Identity, Personal Identity, and the Self*:

```markdown
There is something about practical things that knocks us off our philosophical high horses. Perhaps Heraclitus 
really thought he couldn't step in the same river twice. Perhaps he even received tenure for that contribution 
to philosophy. But suppose some other ancient had claimed to have as much right as Heraclitus did to an ox 
Heraclitus had bought, on the grounds that since the animal had changed, it wasn't the same one he had bought 
and so was up for grabs. Heraclitus would have quickly come up with some ersatz, watered-down version of 
identity of practical value for dealing with property rights, oxen, lyres, vineyards, and the like. And then 
he might have wondered if that watered-down vulgar sense of identity might be a considerably more valuable 
concept than a pure and philosophical sort of identity that nothing has.

Peter Watts, *Blindsight*:

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.

From [Oglaf](http://oglaf.com/bugfuck/epilogue/):

```markdown
In some species of Anglerfish, the male is much smaller than the female and incapable of feeding 
independently. To survive he must smell out a female as soon as he hatches. He bites into her releasing 
an enzime which fuses him to her permanently. He lives off her blood for the rest of his life, providing 
her with sperm whenever she needs it. Females can have multiple males attached. 

The moral is simple: males are parasites, women are sluts. 

Ha! Just kidding! The moral is don't treat actual animal behavior like a fable. Generally speaking, 
animals have no interest in teaching you anything.

Terry Pratchett, *Unseen Academicals*:

```markdown
The Patrician took a sip of his beer. "I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never 
will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a 
stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even 
as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued 
and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split 
and I remember to its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the 
baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. 

One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. 

And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world 
spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his 
moral superior."

Sarah Constantin is one of my favorite writers. She has a blog, [Otium](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/), and goes by 
celandine13 on LiveJournal. This quote on the _error vs bug model of learning_ comes from her LJ essay 
[Errors vs Bugs and the End of Stupidity](https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html).

```markdown
A common mental model for performance is what I'll call the "error model."  In the error model, a person's 
performance of a musical piece (or performance on a test) is a perfect performance plus some random error.  
You can literally think of each note, or each answer, as x + c times epsilon_i, where x is the correct note 
/ answer, and epsilon_i is a random variable, iid Gaussian or something.  Better performers have a lower 
error rate c.  Improvement is a matter of lowering your error rate.  This, or something like it, is the model 
that underlies school grades and test scores. Your grade is based on the percent you get correct.  Your 
performance is defined by a single continuous parameter, your accuracy.

But we could also consider the "bug model" of errors.  A person taking a test or playing a piece of music is 
executing a program, a deterministic procedure.  If your program has a bug, then you'll get a whole class of 
problems wrong, consistently.  Bugs, unlike error rates, can't be quantified along a single axis as less or 
more severe.  A bug gets everything that it affects wrong.  And fixing bugs doesn't improve your performance 
in a continuous fashion; you can fix a "little" bug and immediately go from getting everything wrong to 
everything right.  You can't really describe the accuracy of a buggy program by the percent of questions it 
gets right; if you ask it to do something different, it could suddenly go from 99% right to 0% right.  You 
can only define its behavior by isolating what the bug does.

Often, I think mistakes are more like bugs than errors.  My clinkers weren't random; they were in specific 
places, because I had sub-optimal fingerings in those places.  A kid who gets arithmetic questions wrong 
usually isn't getting them wrong at random; there's something missing in their understanding, like not 
getting the difference between multiplication and addition.  Working generically "harder" doesn't fix bugs 
(though fixing bugs does require work). 

Once you start to think of mistakes as deterministic rather than random, as caused by "bugs" (incorrect 
understanding or incorrect procedures) rather than random inaccuracy, a curious thing happens.

You stop thinking of people as "stupid."

Tags like "stupid," "bad at X", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying "You're performing badly and I 
don't know why." Once you move it to "you're performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or 
"you're performing badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague personal 
failing but a causal necessity. Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. 

It's not you, it's the bug.

Megan McArdle, [Only stupid people call people stupid](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2014-08-12/only-stupid-people-call-people-stupid):

```markdown
I’m always fascinated by the number of people who proudly build columns, tweets, blog posts or Facebook 
posts around the same core statement: “I don’t understand how anyone could (oppose legal abortion/support 
a carbon tax/sympathize with the Palestinians over the Israelis/want to privatize Social Security/insert 
your pet issue here)." It’s such an interesting statement, because it has three layers of meaning.

The first layer is the literal meaning of the words: *I lack the knowledge and understanding to figure this 
out*. But the second, intended meaning is the opposite: *I am such a superior moral being that I cannot even 
imagine the cognitive errors or moral turpitude that could lead someone to such obviously wrong conclusions*. 
And yet, the third, true meaning is actually more like the first: *I lack the empathy, moral imagination or 
analytical skills to attempt even a basic understanding of the people who disagree with me*.

In short, “I’m stupid.” Something that few people would ever post so starkly on their Facebook feeds.

Steven Pinker, [The trouble with Harvard](https://newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests): 

```markdown
A skilled professional I know had to turn down an important freelance assignment because of a recurring 
commitment to chauffeur her son to a resumé-building “social action” assignment required by his high 
school. This involved driving the boy for 45 minutes to a community center, cooling her heels while he 
sorted used clothing for charity, and driving him back—forgoing income which, judiciously donated, could 
have fed, clothed, and inoculated an African village. The dubious “lessons” of this forced labor as an 
overqualified ragpicker are that children are entitled to treat their mothers’ time as worth nothing, 
that you can make the world a better place by destroying economic value, and that the moral worth of 
an action should be measured by the conspicuousness of the sacrifice rather than the gain to the beneficiary.

Douglas Hofstadter on the necessary strangeness of scientific explanations:

```markdown
It is no accident, I would maintain, that quantum mechanics is so wildly counterintuitive. Part of the 
nature of explanation is that it must eventually hit some point where further probing only increases 
opacity rather than decreasing it. 

Consider the problem of understanding the nature of solids. You might wonder where solidity comes form. 
What if someone said to you, "The ultimate basis of this brick's solidity is that it is composed of a 
stupendous number of eensy weensy bricklike objects that themselves are rock-solid"? You might be 
interested to learn that bricks are composed of micro-bricks, but the initial question - "What accounts 
for solidity?" - has been thoroughly begged. What we ultimately want is for solidity to vanish, to 
dissolve, to disintegrate into some totally different kind of phenomenon with which we have no experience. 
Only then, when we have reached some completely novel, alien level will we feel that we have really made 
progress in explaining the top-level phenomenon.

...

I first saw this thought expressed in the stimulating book Patterns of Discovery by Norwood Russell 
Hanson. Hanson attributes it to a number of thinkers, such as Isaac Newton, who wrote, in his famous 
work Opticks: "The parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another, stick together 
very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging 
the Question." Hanson also quotes James Clerk Maxwell (from an article entitled "Atom"): "We may 
indeed suppose the atom elastic, but this is to endow it with the very property for the explanation 
of which... the atomic constitution was originally assumed." Finally, here is a quote Hanson provides 
from Werner Heisenberg himself: "If atoms are really to explain the origin of color and smell of 
visible material bodies, then they cannot possess properties like color and smell." 

So, although it is not an original thought, it is useful to bear in mind that "greenness disintegrates".

From Scott Aaronson's [Quantum Computing Since Democritus](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/01/book-review-and-highlights-quantum-computing-since-democritus/):

```markdown
The third thing that annoys me about the Chinese Room argument is the way it gets so much mileage from 
a possibly misleading choice of imagery, or, one might say, by trying to sidestep the entire issue of 
computational complexity purely through clever framing. We’re invited to imagine someone pushing around 
slips of paper with zero understanding or insight, much like the doofus freshmen who write 
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 on their math tests. 

But how many slips of paper are we talking about! How big would the rule book have to be, and how 
quickly would you have to consult it, to carry out an intelligent Chinese conversation in anything 
resembling real time? If each page of the rule book corresponded to one neuron of a native speaker’s 
brain, then probably we’d be talking about a “rule book” at leas the size of the Earth, its pages 
searchable by a swarm of robots traveling at close to the speed of light. When you put it that way, 
maybe it’s not so hard to imagine this enormous Chinese-speaking entity that we’ve brought into being 
might have something we’d be prepared to call understanding or insight.

Philosophers are so good at pure qualitative distinctions that it’s easy to slip the difference between 
“guy in a room” and “planet being processed by lightspeed robots” under the rug.
