Sarah Constantin is one of my favorite writers. She has a blog, [Otium](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/), and goes by 
celandine13 on LiveJournal. This quote on the _error vs bug model of learning_ comes from her LJ essay 
[Errors vs Bugs and the End of Stupidity](https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html).

A common mental model for performance is what I'll call the "error model."  In the error model, a person's 
performance of a musical piece (or performance on a test) is a perfect performance plus some random error.  
You can literally think of each note, or each answer, as x + c times epsilon_i, where x is the correct note 
/ answer, and epsilon_i is a random variable, iid Gaussian or something.  Better performers have a lower 
error rate c.  Improvement is a matter of lowering your error rate.  This, or something like it, is the model 
that underlies school grades and test scores. Your grade is based on the percent you get correct.  Your 
performance is defined by a single continuous parameter, your accuracy.

But we could also consider the "bug model" of errors.  A person taking a test or playing a piece of music is 
executing a program, a deterministic procedure.  If your program has a bug, then you'll get a whole class of 
problems wrong, consistently.  Bugs, unlike error rates, can't be quantified along a single axis as less or 
more severe.  A bug gets everything that it affects wrong.  And fixing bugs doesn't improve your performance 
in a continuous fashion; you can fix a "little" bug and immediately go from getting everything wrong to 
everything right.  You can't really describe the accuracy of a buggy program by the percent of questions it 
gets right; if you ask it to do something different, it could suddenly go from 99% right to 0% right.  You 
can only define its behavior by isolating what the bug does.

Often, I think mistakes are more like bugs than errors.  My clinkers weren't random; they were in specific 
places, because I had sub-optimal fingerings in those places.  A kid who gets arithmetic questions wrong 
usually isn't getting them wrong at random; there's something missing in their understanding, like not 
getting the difference between multiplication and addition.  Working generically "harder" doesn't fix bugs 
(though fixing bugs does require work). 

Once you start to think of mistakes as deterministic rather than random, as caused by "bugs" (incorrect 
understanding or incorrect procedures) rather than random inaccuracy, a curious thing happens.

You stop thinking of people as "stupid."

Tags like "stupid," "bad at X", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying "You're performing badly and I 
don't know why." Once you move it to "you're performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or 
"you're performing badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague personal 
failing but a causal necessity. Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. 

It's not you, it's the bug.

The rest of the linked article is _fantastic_. I had trouble quoting it because I felt like quoting everything.

I’m always fascinated by the number of people who proudly build columns, tweets, blog posts or Facebook 
posts around the same core statement: “I don’t understand how anyone could (oppose legal abortion/support 
a carbon tax/sympathize with the Palestinians over the Israelis/want to privatize Social Security/insert 
your pet issue here)." It’s such an interesting statement, because it has three layers of meaning.

The first layer is the literal meaning of the words: *I lack the knowledge and understanding to figure this 
out*. But the second, intended meaning is the opposite: *I am such a superior moral being that I cannot even 
imagine the cognitive errors or moral turpitude that could lead someone to such obviously wrong conclusions*. 
And yet, the third, true meaning is actually more like the first: *I lack the empathy, moral imagination or 
analytical skills to attempt even a basic understanding of the people who disagree with me*.

In short, “I’m stupid.” Something that few people would ever post so starkly on their Facebook feeds.

From a BBC interview with a retiring Oxford Don. This personally keeps me up at night. 

>A skilled professional I know had to turn down an important freelance assignment because of a recurring commitment to chauffeur her son to a resumé-building “social action” assignment required by his high school. This involved driving the boy for 45 minutes to a community center, cooling her heels while he sorted used clothing for charity, and driving him back—forgoing income which, judiciously donated, could have fed, clothed, and inoculated an African village. The dubious “lessons” of this forced labor as an overqualified ragpicker are that children are entitled to treat their mothers’ time as worth nothing, that you can make the world a better place by destroying economic value, and that the moral worth of an action should be measured by the conspicuousness of the sacrifice rather than the gain to the beneficiary.
