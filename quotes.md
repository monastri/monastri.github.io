## What is this?

This is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

This is my first experiment in that vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) is another major inspiration behind this document.

## Amazing people

<a name="#Andrey-Kolmogorov"></a>
### Andrey Kolmogorov
([overview](#overview))

Andrey Kolmogorov was the (only slightly) poorer man's version of [Johnny von Neumann](#johnny-von-neumann). He was born in 1903, eight months earlier than von Neumann, but lived thirty years longer. Von Neumann was only nineteen when he published two major math papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, superseding Cantor’s definition; that same year Kolmogorov wrote a paper on operations on sets which was a major generalization of results obtained by Suslin, then gained international prominence for constructing a Fourier series that diverges almost everywhere, something experts considered wholly unexpected. 

Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold:

```markdown
Almost simultaneously [Kolmogorov] exhibited his interest in a number of other areas of classical 
analysis: in problems of differentiation and integration, in measures of sets etc. In every one of his
papers, dealing with such a variety of topics, he introduced an element of originality, a breadth of 
approach, and a depth of thought.
```

He published eight papers in 1925 alone, all written while he was still an undergrad at MSU, and by the time he received his doctorate in 1929 Kolmogorov already had 18 papers to his name.

The 1930s were the mathematical heydays of both von Neumann and Kolmogorov. The latter in particular published over sixty papers during that decade alone in at least *eleven* different fields:

```markdown
… probability theory, projective geometry, mathematical statistics, the theory of functions of a real 
variable, topology, mathematical logic, mathematical biology, philosophy and the history of mathematics.
```

He was only thirty when he published Foundations of the Theory of Probability, laying the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory and establishing his reputation as the world's leading expert in this field, and in the process bringing respectability to a discipline suffering from lack of foundations.

Like that of von Neumann, Kolmogorov’s work covered every area of mathematics except number theory. A non-exhaustive list of areas he enriched by his fundamental research:

```markdown
The theory of trigonometric series, measure theory, set theory, the theory of integration, constructive
logic (intuitionism), topology, approximation theory, probability theory, the theory of random processes, 
information theory, mathematical statistics, dynamical systems, automata theory, theory of algorithms, 
mathematical linguistics, turbulence theory, celestial mechanics, differential equations, Hilbert's 6th 
and 13th problems, ballistics, and applications of mathematics to problems of biology, geology, and the
crystallization of metals.
```

Kolmogorov was clearly a giant of a mathematical scientist in the highest sense of the word, so much so that I wonder why he didn’t have von Neumann’s reputation for brains. My best guess is that he wasn’t a mental calculator like von Neumann. The easiest way to *viscerally* demonstrate “wow brains!” is to do the sort of party tricks von Neumann used to regale his audience with—out-calculating (early) computers, instantly summing infinite series, translating books by heart “with no diminution in speech rate”, memorizing entire pages from phone books on command and suchlike—which Kolmogorov probably didn’t do.

### Charlie Fefferman
([overview](#overview))

I've known about Charles Fefferman for a few years now, but never really bothered to check out his background. I vaguely thought of him as Terry Tao before Terry Tao: both work in analysis, both are extremely accomplished and productive (Tao probably more so, since he seems to explicitly optimize for productivity to a degree I find unusual even in top-tier mathematicians), both garnered a reputation very early on for consistently solving really tough problems (the kind more naturally associated with high IQ than artistic creativity, more Gauss than Grothendieck if that makes sense), both have an impressive string of awards to their name, and both growing up were prodigies – in the most rarefied sense of the word. 

You know Tao's story already. Here's a quick run-through from memory: scored 760 on the Math portion of the SAT (99th percentile score) at 8 on his first try (only one other 8-year-old ever scored more than 700, Lenhard Ng, and it was his fifth try), youngest IMO medalist ever at 10 (bronze), youngest IMO silver ever (year after), youngest IMO gold ever (year after), graduated at 16, Ph.D. from Princeton at 20 under the renowned analyst Elias Stein, same year published his first (four) papers, full professor at UCLA at 24, Fields Medal at 31. 

Fefferman's story, interestingly, parallels and predates Tao's by about 26 years or so. In fact he was slightly ahead even. A summary: started college at 12, published his first paper at 15 (!), graduated at 17, Ph.D. also from Princeton at 20 under Elias Stein (!), full professor at University of Chicago at 22 (youngest at major university in US history), Fields Medal at 29 (youngest ever, since surpassed).

Although I'm a fan of Tao, I honestly think that some of the effusive praise surrounding him is a bit overmuch -- see for instance [the University of St Andrew's bio on Terry](#terry-tao). But even *that* doesn't compare to how Charlie was lauded back in the day. When I dug through old news articles on thirty-year-old Fefferman, I found the kind of praise that puts the above to shame: "perhaps the greatest mathematical genius of this century" and its variants popped up in the first two articles I found! Also others, like "certainly every mathematician in this country knows Charlie Fefferman". 

The anecdotes on young Fefferman strike me as representative of someone who wasn't just very good at math, but very smart in general. When he was four, the local auto mechanic at Silver Springs told his mom that "anytime the little kid wants a job here he's hired", since *by the age of four* he was already "better than any mechanic [he'd] ever met" (!).Later he took an interest in dinosaurs, and got so obsessed with them that his impromptu "lectures" on fossil exhibits at the Smithsonian to his younger brother reputedly drew throngs of followers. Tall tales, all of them, each as fun to read as the next.

Incidentally, Fefferman wrote the [laudatio](http://www.icm2006.org/proceedings/Vol_I/7.pdf) summarizing Tao's work leading to the latter winning the Fields. I like to see it as the passing of a torch from a Fields prodigy to another. Winning the Fields is rare enough. Winning it before the age of 32 – this sounds somewhat arbitrary, but by that I mean two cycles early, meaning you had two more chances to win it when older people past 36 have none, so you'd have to be really deserving of the award to take a spot from one of them – is much rarer still. I only know three. Two of them are Fefferman and Tao.

There's a quote by Fefferman of Tao that goes: "He's wonderful. There are a few in a generation, and he's one of the few." So are you, Charlie, so are you.

### Johnny von Neumann
([overview](#overview))

From Cosma Shalizi's [notebook on Johnny](http://bactra.org/notebooks/von-neumann.html):

```markdown
Johnny, as it seems everyone called him, was one of those people who are so bright it's hard to believe
they were human. 

(Maybe he wasn't. There's an old joke about the Fermi Paradox, a problem which occured to Enrico Fermi 
one day at Los Alamos: where are They? If there are intelligent aliens out there in the universe, why
aren't they here yet? A million years is nothing, as the universe reckons things, but, judging from our
own track-record, a species only that much older than us would have technology which would blow our minds,
pretty close to limits set by physical laws. Leo Szilard is supposed to have answered Fermi: "Maybe they
're already here, and you just call them Hungarians.")

About the only large current of the natural sciences in this century which von Neumann's work has *not* 
added to is molecular biology. Almost everything else of any signficance he touched: mathematical logic; 
pure math; quantum physics; computing (which, as we know it, is largely his invention), cybernetics and 
automata theory; the Bomb; turbulence; game theory (another invention) and so economics, evolutionary 
biology, and the theory of war and conflict; artificial life, cellular automata (a third invention), the
theory of self-reproduction (which, with molecular biology, finally killed off any last lingering hopes 
for vitalism) and artificial evolution. What many of us like to think of as new and profound changes in 
the way science works, brought about by computer modelling and simulation, were forseen and called for by
von Neumman in the '40s. If any one person can be said to be the intellectual ancestor of complexity and
all that travels alongside it, it was Johnny. His only real rival for the honor is Norbert Wiener, a better
man but a less overwhelming scientist.
```

All this, in thirty-odd years. Von Neumann died relatively young, aged fifty-three, from either bone or pancreatic cancer. I’ve often wondered what else he would have accomplished had he lived longer, how much more he might have done. 

(I think I know now the answer: Johnny von Neumann would have probably been a richer man’s version of Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, and I’m not so sure about the “richer” part. See [here](#Andrey-Kolmogorov).)

The ever-entertaining Steve Yegge on Johnny, from his essay [Math every day](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/math-every-day):

```markdown
Von Neumann was originally "just" a mathematician (and chemical engineer), but he made lasting and
often central contributions to fields other than pure mathematics. Yes, he invented the computer and
computer programming as we know it, which is a fine thing to have on your resume, but it's only a 
tiny part of his work. The list is so long that the book I read couldn't begin to mention it all, 
let alone discuss it. I'll list a handful of his accomplishments here, but they don't begin to paint
the full picture.

Johnny co-invented game theory, made critical contributions to the field of economics, and extended 
his game theory to formalize the theory of linear programming, which is now a staple optimization 
method for many disciplines, including some that we employ at Amazon (e.g. operations research).

He singlehandedly invented the theory of cellular automata -- you know, the one that madman Stephen 
Wolfram tries to take credit for in A New Kind of Science -- and was one of the pioneers of methods
for understanding the human brain, which spun off any number of sub-fields.

He also did pioneering work in the theory of building large, reliable systems comprised of unreliable
components.

He was one of the key contributors to the atomic bomb on the Manhattan Project. He's the one who 
suggested the implosion device for achieving reliable detonation (they had been trying to use a 
gun/projectile method), and he was instrumental in working out the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic 
problems in understanding the shock waves and blast behavior. Regardless of your feelings about nuclear
weapons, you have to appreciate his contributions in a critical wartime initiative.

He made many major contributions to the field of numerical approximation. Many real-world problems are 
non-tractable to mathematical analysis; e.g. they're only describable by systems of high-order partial 
differential equations. Johnny tackled these problems with gusto, inventing or extending a huge number
of different approaches for doing approximations or probabilistic analyses that yielded results where
rigorous analysis had failed.

This is the primary reason that he went to all the effort to invent the modern computer. He wasn't 
satisfied with simply designing and building it; he used it to solve a huge variety of real-life problems.

For instance -- and this is just one example -- he turned weather forecasting into a science. Before
Johnny decided to tackle the problem (and he knew nothing of meteorology; he had to learn it in order 
to solve it), it wasn't possible to get accurate 24-hour weather predictions, and the experts in the 
field had given up hope of ever making scientific weather predictions. You now get accurate weather 
forecasts because Johnny decided it was an interesting problem.
```

Yegge On "what computers really are":

```markdown
Another realization I had while reading the book (John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing) 
is that just about every course I took in my CS degree was either invented by Johnny von Neumann, or 
it's building on his work in mostly unintelligent ways.

Where to start? Before von Neumann, the only electronic computing devices were calculators. He invented
the modern computer, effectively simulating a Universal Turing Machine because he felt a sequential 
device would be cheaper and faster to manufacture than a parallel one. I'd say at least 80% of what we
learned in our undergrad machine-architecture course was straight out of his first report on designing
a programmable computer. It really hasn't changed much.

He created a sequential-instruction device with a fast calculation unit but limited memory and slow 
data transfer (known as the infamous "von Neumann bottleneck", as if he's somehow responsible for
everyone else being too stupid in the past 60 years to come up with something better. In fact, Johnny was
well on his way to coming up with a working parallel computer based on neuron-like cellular automata; he 
probably would have had one in production by 1965 if he hadn't tragically died of cancer in 1957, at age 54.)

Von Neumann knew well the limitations of his sequential computer, but needed to solve real problems with
it, so he invented everything you'd need to do so: encoding machine instructions as numbers, fixed-point
arithmetic, conditional branching, iteration and program flow control, subroutines, debugging and error 
checking (both hardware and software), algorithms for converting binary to decimal and back, and mathematical
and logical systems for modelling problems so they could be solved (or approximated) on his computing machine.

He did much of the hardware and materials engineering himself, working closely with engineers to come up
with solutions for memory, secondary storage, input and output (including hooking up an oscilloscope to the
computer to visually check results that were too complex for punch cards). He secured the funding for building
the computer and computing lab from government and other sources, developed training programs to teach people
how to program computers, and worked with domain experts to find problems that were too hard for mathematical
analysis but tractable to numerical solutions on his computer.

Of course he knew what was computable on his machine, because he worked out new definitions of elegance and
efficiency, came up with the mathematical models for analyzing the complexity of algorithms being executed on
his device, and with his staff, ran hundreds of experiments to learn what worked well and what didn't.

John von Neumann invented our universe.

Then he died at the depressingly early age of 54, robbing the world of perhaps the greatest genius of the 
20th century. "Those who know" generally seem to rank Albert Einstein ahead of von Neumann, but Johnny
always gets a solid #2 vote. Frankly, though, I think Johnny had a far bigger impact on my life, and not 
just because I'm a programmer. What did Albert do, really? Dashed all our hopes of faster-than-light travel,
that's what he did. Whined a lot about not agreeing with quantum mechanics, that's what he did. To the best
of my knowledge, Einstein didn't even know EJB, which according to many Amazon folks makes him a retard.

When I say that von Neumann invented our universe, I'm not trying to be poetic or rhetorical. What I'm saying 
is that his *first* attempt at a computing machine, one that he didn't really like all that much and considered
mostly a prototype, is still the one sitting on my desk today. That means we're a bunch of frigging boneheads.
You, me, everyone.
```

More of the same from Yegge:

```markdown
Discrete math, data structures, algorithms: they've all been refined since he died, sure, but he started
it all. Virtually every discipline that we think of as "computer science" is like Euclidean geometry: 
useful, sure, but far from the only kind out there.

Operating systems, threads, and processes are just a pathetic attempt at fooling you into thinking you have
a parallel computer, right? Gosh, computers are so darn fast that you can have the processor zing around
like Feyman's hypothetical "only electron in the universe", and it almost looks as if we're smart. But we're
not. All the world at large truly understands is serial execution, which is precisely why we're so lost in
the whole distributed computing space. Everyone talks about agents and crawlers and web services and all
this other crap we don't understand; Johnny would have taken one look at it and invented tractable
mathematical solutions.

Compilers: now there's one discipline where Johnny clearly didn't have much influence. He was a big old-
school proponent of doing everything in machine code. He might have changed his mind if he'd lived another 
few decades; hard to say. But ordinary mortals realized they needed shortcuts: higher-level languages that
would be translated into Johnny's machine instructions.

So people came up with a bunch of crap-ass languages that still had the exact same abstractions as the
underlying machine: a global memory that you update by issuing statements or instructions, expressions
that can be computed by the arithmetic-logic unit, conditional branching and loops, subroutines.
Everything you need to be "Turing-complete", which is equivalent to von Neumann-complete.

The new languages simply added various shortcuts: named storage locations ("variables"), syntax for dealing
with memory addresses, "types" for telling the compiler that a variable comes from a particular set of valid
values and has a particular set of legal operations, "scopes" and "namespaces" for organizing your code a
little better, "objects" for anthropomorphizing your data so it can be happy or sad (mostly sad), and other
cruft.

Bu it's all crap. Why? Because it's all just sugaring for the capabilities of assembly language on von
Neumann serial machines, plus a smattering of support for calling into the operating system code so you
can pretend your program is performing truly parallel operations. And none of that parallel stuff works
very well, since we don't understand it, because we don't know math.

What about data structures, you ask? Surely that's one island of purity, something that exists outside of
the von Neumann universe? After all, we worked so hard to understand them. (Well, some of us did. Plenty 
of folks didn't even do that; they just call an API and it all works like magic.)

Sorry to disappoint you, but most of our data structures are fundamentally based on Johnny's sequential 
machine. Think of all those pointers: they're just memory addresses. The best you can do for a sorting 
algorithm, complexity-wise, assuming radix sort isn't possible, is n*logn. Or so you thought; there are
parallel algorithms that run in linear time. All your cherished data structures are simply the best that
clever people could do at organizing data on a Turing Machine. If someone created a set of data structures
whose pointers were URLs, that would be a step away from von Neumann.

What about SMP or NUMA? Surely adding multiple processors is a huge step towards parallel computing? Nope,
sorry. Well, not much of one. There's still a von Neumann bottleneck; the channel has just been made a bit 
shorter. We need it to be made infinitely wider by creating a truly parallel computer that doesn't consist
of CPUs all trying to update the same global store.

Face it: Computer Science was a misnomer. It should have been called Johnny's First Universe.
```

Yegge on Johnny "making intractable problems tractable":

```markdown
Mathematicians have traditionally avoided problems that they considered "intractable" to analysis. 
They've known about numerical methods for centuries; even Newton devised a few, as did the ancient Greeks. 
But brute-force methods have traditionally been met with some disdain, because the results of large-scale
human computations rarely justify the cost of the undertaking.

Clairaut's work in 1757, in which he and two other people labored for 5 months to trace the orbit of 
Halley's Comet to compute its perihelion, garnered widespread criticism after his team missed the true 
perihelion by thirty-one days. Larger-scale computing groups have met with similar results: you can perform
large, expensive computations, e.g. to create trigonometric tables, but humans make errors, and human 
computers generate unreliable output that becomes worse the harder they push to get it done faster.

Before von Neumann's programmable computer, mathematicians had few other options. They pushed pure analysis
to its limits, but some physical and natural phenomena can only be described with complex systems of 
equations that cannot be solved analytically. Many problems had to be solved informally.

Von Neumann changed all that; he embraced numerical methods and invented entire new branches of math for use
with the computers he was inventing -- the sequential computer for the most part, but also his planned 
parallel computers. And he was able to perform larger and larger computing tasks with small-ish teams. When
a task grew large enough, requiring more than, say, 20 people, it was considered intractable. Rather than 
trying to secure funding for more people, he and his colleagues went to work on creating intrinsically more 
powerful mathematical models to make the problem tractable.

And don't you think for a moment that his problems were "easier" than the ones Amazon faces today. Looking
at the speed at which he was pioneering the development of parallel computational models and research on
intelligent, self-reproducing, self-repairing systems in the last few years of his life, it's pretty clear
that he would have been successful. Johnny's approach was to make intractable tasks tractable.
```

This quote isn't that relevant, but it touched me. Steve Yegge in [Moore's law is crap](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/moores-law-is-crap.html):

```markdown
You *do* realize that John von Neumann spent the last 10 years of his life singlehandedly developing a 
theory of computing based on cellular automata? The computer you're reading this blog rant on was his
frigging prototype! He was going to throw it out and make a better one! And then he died of cancer, just
like my brother Dave did, just like so many people with so much more to give and so much more life to live.
And we're not making headway on cancer, either, because our computers and languages are such miserable crap.
```

Wolfram on von Neumann, from [John von Neumann's 100th birthday](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/):

```markdown
Some scientists (such as myself) spend most of their lives pursuing their own grand programs, ultimately in a fairly isolated way. John von Neumann was instead someone who always liked to interact with the latest popular issues—and the people around them—and then contribute to them in his own characteristic way.

He worked hard, often on many projects at once, and always seemed to have fun. In retrospect, he chose most of his topics remarkably well. He studied each of them with a definite practical mathematical style. And partly by being the first person to try applying serious mathematical methods in various areas, he was able to make important and unique contributions.
```

The fullest version of the Dantzig-meets-von Neumann story I’ve seen comes from the [IFORS Operational Research Hall of Fame article](http://www.cs.xu.edu/~neyer/Math/NumberTheory/Research/VonNeumann.pdf) on the latter:

```markdown
Looking at von Neumann’s game theory mathematical results in terms of matrix and linear relationships,
one can see how and why von Neumann reacted to George Dantzig’s description of the newly formulated 
linear-programming model when they first met in 1947. Here is that story as told by Dantzig 
(1982, p. 45):

On October 3, 1947, I visited him (von Neumann) for the first time at the Institute for Advanced Study 
at Princeton. I remember trying to describe to von Neumann, as I would to an ordinary mortal, the Air
Force problem. I began with the formulation of the linear programming model in terms of activities and
items, etc. Von Neumann did something which I believe was uncharacteristic of him. ‘‘Get to the point,’’
he said impatiently. Having at times a somewhat low kindling-point, I said to myself ‘‘O.K., if he wants
a quicky, then that’s what he will get.’’ In under one minute I slapped the geometric and algebraic
version of the problem on the blackboard. Von Neumann stood up and said ‘‘Oh that!’’ Then for the next 
hour and a half, he proceeded to give me a lecture on the mathematical theory of linear programs.

At one point seeing me sitting there with my eyes popping and my mouth open (after I had searched the 
literature and found nothing), von Neumann said: ‘‘I don’t want you to think I am pulling all this out of
my sleeve at the spur of the moment like a magician. I have just recently completed a book with Oscar
[sic] Morgenstern on the theory of games. What I am doing is conjecturing that the two problems are 
equivalent. The theory that I am outlining for your problem is an analogue to the one we have developed 
for games.’’ Thus I learned about Farkas’ Lemma, and about duality for the first time.
```

This certainly sounds more reasonable / realistic than the version perpetuated in folklore, which has von Neumann (completely out of the blue, as it were) developing the theory in a 1.5-hour lecture to a flabbergasted Dantzig after the latter had just begun describing the simplex method to vN. JvN was (to quote Trump on Kim Jong Un) “a pretty smart cookie”, or (paraphrasing user ‘mathwonk’ on Ed Witten) “a little smarter than the average bear”, but the standard folklore version makes him out to be completely superhuman.

### Butler Lampson
([overview](#overview))

Alan Kay, answering [I don't want be a specialist. How can I be a great generalist in computer science?](https://www.quora.com/I-dont-want-be-a-specialist-How-can-I-be-a-great-generalist-in-computer-science):

```markdown
Every once in a while I’m asked “what does it mean to be a computer scientist?” My answer is “I 
don’t know exactly, but take a look at Butler Lampson. He is certainly the quintessential Computer
Scientist if ever there was one”. He must have been the easiest Turing Award winner to choose in 
1992 (the top recognition in computing)… Certainly in the top few of the most impressive people 
I’ve ever met, and especially to have had the fun of working with.
```

I found this really intriguing for three reasons. The first reason is that I’d been reading a lot of Alan Kay’s answers on Quora recently, and I liked that he was a dreamer of a pioneer who was good enough to make headway on those dreams — good enough to win him the Turing Award himself, in fact; Alan Kay’s one of the few people I wouldn’t hesitate to apply the overused word visionary to — and it took a lot to impress him, so getting singled out for such glowing praise from Kay (over the likes of Donald Knuth!) was certainly something. It also helped that Kay praises Lampson for being a generalist, and portrays him as being a true “end-to-end” contributor, which I liked since I’ve repeatedly said on [my blog](https://mosstuff.quora.com) that generalists and subfield-cross-pollinators and their kin are My Kind Of People.

The second reason is that it hasn’t been that long since I read [these two](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/math-every-day) [blog posts](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.my/2006/03/moores-law-is-crap.html) by Steve Yegge, and thought sure, JvN probably had more raw mental horsepower than anyone else in the 20th century, but he also had the advantage of being the first person to ‘mathematize’ fields that hadn’t yet been ‘mathematized’, so that there were low-hanging fruit by the bushel; what might he have done if he were born a couple decades late? At least if we confine ourselves to computer science (and since we’re using Alan Kay’s definition of computer science as the study of systems and processes very broadly construed, this isn’t even much of a constraint), the answer, judging from the way his peers all talk about him, in addition to his own [ridiculously long list of systems he’s worked on](http://bwlampson.site/Systems.htm), seems to be Butler Lampson. Seriously, go skim through that list and tell me you don’t feel the same way you do in going through JvN’s ‘known for’ list on Wikipedia.

The third reason was that on a lark, I decided to skim through some of his [lecture notes](http://bwlampson.site/48-POCScourse/48-POCS2006Abstract.html) for the Principles of Computer Systems course he taught at MIT, and I was struck by their no-nonsense near-incompressible density — I tend to be sensitive to fluff in technical reads, because I lose the forest for the trees more easily than most, which is why I make it a habit to summarize the heck out of lecture note-style reads online on a topic I get interested in; Lampson’s lecture notes seemed like they were already summarized, which gave the impression of a ton of mental horsepower.

(Also, see this: [Turing100 Event Report: Work of Butler Lampson - Systems](http://punetech.com/turing100-event-report-work-of-butler-lampson-systems/))

The quotes themselves are pretty fun — maybe not in the same ballpark as the almost-whimsical ones about von Neumann and Ed Witten, but not too far behind.

Various Turing Award winners talking about Butler Lampson at LampsonFest in much the same way Nobel Prize winners used to talk about Johnny von Neumann:

```markdown
Butler Lampson has as good a claim as anyone to the title of “father of the modern PC.” …

Lampson turned 70 in December; last week, a group of computer science luminaries gathered at 
Microsoft Research New England, at the edge of the MIT campus, for a daylong conference celebrating
his achievements.

Two major themes emerged from the morning sessions. The first was the sheer range of Lampson’s 
technical innovation. The other theme of the morning sessions was just how formidable — and, as
Metcalfe put it, “fast” — Lampson is in debate.

Sproull mentioned a unit of measure used in computer science circles, which indicates the “speed
of delivery of technical information” and is known as the lampson. “Most of us could ourselves only
achieve millilampsons,” Sproull said.
```

From [Cool jargon of the day](http://www.jargon.net/jargon/cool/):

```markdown
milliLampson /mil'*-lamp`sn/ /n./ A unit of talking speed, abbreviated mL. Most people run about 
200 milliLampsons. The eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems implementor highly regarded 
among hackers) goes at 1000. A few people speak faster.

This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes widely disparate) rates at which people can 
generate ideas and actually emit them in speech. For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell
(designer of the PDP-11) is said, with some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at about 300; 
he is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth tries to keep up with his speeding brain.
```

More from Alan Kay:

```markdown
We find in Butler someone who covers in knowledge and skills a very wide range in computing and 
software engineering, who has not just designed/invented but also built operating systems, programming
languages, networking and internetworking systems, desktop media, specification languages, atomic 
transaction protocols, and much more, and hardware architectures and detailed designs for making hardware
... And more. A partial summary is here.

He must have been the easiest Turing Award winner to choose in 1992 (the top recognition in computing),
and is one of the few ever to have also been awarded the top engineering award, the IEEE John von Neumann
Award. He was inducted into both the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering...

Once in an ARPAnet design meeting in the 60s, Butler was supposed to give a one hour talk at the end of 
the day, but the meeting dragged on. When it was his turn, he looked at his watch and said “I’ve got a plane
I have to catch”, and proceeded to give the -entire- talk in 20 minutes, in perfect understandable English 
at great speed! It was shockingly impressive even from him. The person next to me said “It’s a great 
privilege to just know someone like Butler”. That talk — on a capability based operating system design — 
covered the content in a paper you can read.

Butler is also one of the clearest writers in our field. Here is a partial list of his papers over the years.
And here is the first page of his website with a few tips on stuff to look at that has been most popular with 
readers.

Certainly in the top few of the most impressive people I’ve ever met, and especially to have had the fun of
working with.

I think that — besides Butler’s obvious brilliance — there are a few keys to his range and depth, and many
of these revolve around -systems and processes- rather than hardware and software, or programming languages
and operating systems. Dealing with whole systems was in the zeitgeist of the ARPA community back then, and
it found Butler while on his way — after an undergrad degree in Physics from Harvard — to grad school in 
Physics at Berkeley. As he puts it “I walked in the wrong door and found people trying to debug code for a
new computer. And never found the doorway out”.

Butler was and is interested in -anything- that has dynamic relationships — systems and processes — (and
note the analogies with what is studied in physics). I think looking at the world this way — all systems
and processes (including physical and biological) — will round you into a “generalist in computer scientist” 
who can be a vital contributor not just a dabbler. There are only a few people around like Butler, but how
he has gone about his art can be and is an inspiration for the rest of us.
```

Leslie Lamport [talking about](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/part-time-parliament/?from=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) how Butler Lampson was the only person to understand the significance of his Paxos algorithm:

```markdown
I thought, and still think, that Paxos is an important algorithm. Inspired by my success at popularizing the consensus problem by describing it with Byzantine generals, I decided to cast the algorithm in terms of a parliament on an ancient Greek island. Leo Guibas suggested the name Paxos for the island. I gave the Greek legislators the names of computer scientists working in the field, transliterated with Guibas’s help into a bogus Greek dialect. (Peter Ladkin suggested the title.) Writing about a lost civilization allowed me to eliminate uninteresting details and indicate generalizations by saying that some details of the parliamentary protocol had been lost. To carry the image further, I gave a few lectures in the persona of an Indiana-Jones-style archaeologist, replete with Stetson hat and hip flask.

My attempt at inserting some humor into the subject was a dismal failure. People who attended my lecture remembered Indiana Jones, but not the algorithm. People reading the paper apparently got so distracted by the Greek parable that they didn’t understand the algorithm. Among the people I sent the paper to, and who claimed to have read it, were Nancy Lynch, Vassos Hadzilacos, and Phil Bernstein. A couple of months later I emailed them the following question:

Can you implement a distributed database that can tolerate the failure of any number of its processes (possibly all of them) without losing consistency, and that will resume normal behavior when more than half the processes are again working properly?

None of them noticed any connection between this question and the Paxos algorithm.

I submitted the paper to TOCS in 1990. All three referees said that the paper was mildly interesting, though not very important, but that all the Paxos stuff had to be removed. I was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be, so I did nothing with the paper. A number of years later, a couple of people at SRC needed algorithms for distributed systems they were building, and Paxos provided just what they needed. …

So, I thought that maybe the time had come to try publishing it again.

Meanwhile, the one exception in this dismal tale was Butler Lampson, who immediately understood the algorithm’s significance. He mentioned it in lectures and in a paper, and he interested Nancy Lynch in it. De Prisco, Lynch, and Lampson published their version of a specification and proof. Their papers made it more obvious that it was time for me to publish my paper. …

big, yellow, boring-looking books edited by Springer. These dozens of volumes...are still our most

I've had the chance...to meet quite a number of people, both among my "elders" and among young

admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if 
familiar with them from the cradle - while for myself I felt clumsy. even oafish, wandering 
painfully up a arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I 
had to learn ( so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or 
following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright
student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most
forbidding subjects.

### Terry Tao
([overview](#overview))

The University of St Andrew's [biography](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tao.html) of Terry has some of the more effusive (overmuch, honestly) praise I've ever seen for an active mathematician. I mean, look at these sentences, pretty much randomly picked:

```markdown
It is very difficult to write a biography of someone who is at the height of their creative
powers as Tao is. Anything that one writes about his research contributions will be quickly 
outdated as he is contributing major results in such a wide range of different areas.

[He] has produced such a fantastic collection of results, leading to the award of all the top
prizes in mathematics, that one must try to at least give a vague picture of the work of this
remarkable mathematician.

To dismiss this fantastic achievement in a single sentence seems silly, but there is so much
more to say.

Before looking at his contributions we note the prizes and awards he has received (although 
again this list is bound to become rapidly outdated as he continues to receive awards).

One might imagine that with his remarkable output of research papers, Tao would not find time 
to write books. However, this would be entirely wrong since he has produced both research
monographs and undergraduate texts.

But, amazingly, this still does not complete the list of Tao's 2006 books...

It will come as no surprise to learn that Tao, who is such an innovator in everything he does,
has created a new style of book. ...
```

Tim Gowers on Terry, in a review:

```markdown
Textbooks and popular science are still the two obvious niches for mathematics in the book market,
but the advent of the Internet has brought about a sudden change in the possibilities for mathematical
exposition, because now anybody can put anything they like on the Web. As a result, there has been a
rapid rise in a form of mathematical exposition that is too technical for the layperson, but much 
easier to read and enjoy for mathematicians than a textbook. A medium that is particularly well 
suited to this is the blog, and the undisputed king of all mathematics blogs, with thousands of regular
readers, is that of Terence Tao. 

Tao's mathematical knowledge has an extraordinary combination of breadth and depth: he can write 
confidently and authoritatively on topics as diverse as partial differential equations, analytic number
theory, the geometry of 3-manifolds, nonstandard analysis, group theory, model theory, quantum mechanics, 
probability, ergodic theory, combinatorics, harmonic analysis, image processing, functional analysis, and 
many others. Some of these are areas to which he has made fundamental contributions. Others are areas that 
he appears to understand at the deep intuitive level of an expert despite officially not working in those 
areas. 

How he does all this, as well as writing papers and books at a prodigious rate, is a complete mystery. It
has been said that Hilbert was the last person to know all of mathematics, but it is not easy to find gaps
in Tao's knowledge, and if you do then you may well find that the gaps have been filled a year later. Now,
in an interesting experiment, several of Tao's blog posts have been tidied up (partly in response to 
comments from others on the posts) and published as books.
```

From an article describing the award of the Fields:

```markdown
Terence Tao is a supreme problem-solver whose spectacular work has had an impact across several 
mathematical areas. He combines sheer technical power, an other-worldly ingenuity for hitting upon new 
ideas, and a startlingly natural point of view that leaves other mathematicians wondering, " Why didn't 
anyone see that before?" At 31 years of age, Tao has written over eighty research papers, with over thirty
collaborators, and his interests range over a wide swath of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, 
nonlinear partial differential equations, and combinatorics. "I work in a number of areas, but I don't view
them as being disconnected," he said in an interview published in the Clay Mathematics Institute Annual Report.
"I tend to view mathematics as a unified subject and am particularly happy when I get the opportunity to work on
a project that involves several fields at once."
```

Julian Stanley of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) wrote the following about Terry in his 1986 report [Radical Acceleration in Australia: Terence Tao](http://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10116), when Terry was still 10:

```markdown
On May 1985 I administered to [10 year old] Terry the Raven Progressive Matrices Advanced, an untimed
test. He completed its 36 8-option items in about 45 minutes. Whereas the average British university 
student scores 21, Terry scored 32. He did not miss any of the last, most difficult, 4 items. Also,
when told which 4 items he had not answered correctly, he was quickly able to find the correct
response to each. Few of SMPY's ablest protégés, members of its "700-800 on SAT-M Before Age 13"
group, could do as well.
```

Jonah Sinick expands upon Stanley's remark above in the following quote from his LW post [Innate mathematical ability](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5Xrv5aXfb95uHcseN/innate-mathematical-ability):

```markdown
People like Terry are perhaps 1 in a million, but I've had the chance to tutor several children who 
are in his general direction.

Descriptions of milestones like "scored 760 on the math SAT at age 8" (as Terry did) usually greatly
understate the ability of these children when the milestone is interpreted as "comparable to a high 
school student in the top 1%," in that there's a connotation that the child's performance comes from
the child having learned the usual things very quickly. The situation is usually closer to "the child
hasn't learned the usual things, but is able to get high scores by solving questions ththat high
school students wouldn't able to able to solve without having studied algebra and geometry."

A impact of interacting with such a child can be overwhelming. I've repeatedly had the experience of
teaching such a child a mathematical topic typically covered only in graduate math courses, and one 
that I know well beyond the level of textbook expositions, and the child responding by making 
observations that I myself had missed. The experience is surreal, to the point that I wouldn't have 
been surprised to learn that it had all been a dream 30 minutes later.

Tangentially, I don't know why we were assigned this problem, which is of considerable mathematical 
interest, but also outside of the usual high school curriculum. In any case, I remember puzzling over
it. Based on my experiences with children similar to Terry, it seems likely that his 8-year old self
would see how to answer it immediately, without having ever seen anything like the problem before.
Roughly speaking, an 8-year old child like Terry can recognize abstract patterns that very few (if 
any) of a group of 30 high school students with the math SAT score would be able to recognize.
```

Terry is very math-skewed. Back to Stanley:

```markdown
Yet at age 8 years 10 months, when he took both the SAT-M and the SAT-Verbal, Terry scored only 290
on the latter. Just 9% of college-bound male 12th-graders score 290 or less on SAT-V; a chance score
is about 230. The discrepancy between being 10 points above the minimum 99th percentile on M and at 
the 9th percentile on V represents a gap of about 3.7 standard deviations. Clearly, Terry did far 
better with the mathematical reasoning items (please see the Appendix for examples) than he did 
reading paragraphs and answering comprehension questions about them or figuring out antonyms, verbal 
analogies, or sentences with missing words.

Was the "lowness" of the verbal score (excellent for one his age, of course) due to his lack of
motivation on that part of the test and/or surprise at its content? A year later, while this
altogether charming boy was spending four days at my home during early May of 1985, I administered 
another form of the SAT-V to him under the best possible conditions. His score rose to 380, which is 
the 31st percentile. That's a fine gain, but the M vs. V discrepancy was probably as great as before.
Quite likely, on the SAT score scale his ability had risen appreciably above the 800 ceiling of SAT-M. 
```

Some other nice quotes from Stanley's report:

```markdown
Ten-year-old Terence Tao, or Adelaide, South Australia, is a prodigiously gifted young mathematician.
Julian Stanley, Director of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) at Johns Hopkins 
University states that Terry has the greatest mathematical reasoning ability he has found in 14 
years of intensive searching (Stanley, 1985). ...

In some ways it is ironical that such a profoundly gifted student as Terry should have appeared in
Australia, an obsessively egalitarian society where social antipathy towards gifted children and 
towards those who would set up special programs for the gifted is a powerful deterrent to the
establishment of state-mandated gifted programs. Two Australian states, Western Australia and
Victoria, do provide structured accelerated programs for highly gifted secondary school students 
within the government system, but these programs are under intense criticism from the teachers' unions, 
the media and many politicians. Terry's state, South Australia, has no such program; the few cases of 
acceleration which have arisen have proceeded from the interest and concern of individual teachers and
have received little or no support from the state education system.
```

Terry's father, Dr. Billy Tao, a pediatrician, "paradoxically" feels that in Terry's case the absence of a formalized structure may have been an advantage rather than a hindrance:

```markdown
My wife and I have been fortunate in having been able to work very closely, first with the principals 
and staffs of Terry's primary and secondary schools and later with the faculty of Flinder University,
to design a highly individualized program which has been tied in to Terry's levels of ability in all 
subject areas, not only in maths and the sciences but also in the humanities. If South Australia had 
already had well established gifted programs, Terry might have been drawn into a less flexible system,
quite different from what has actually eventuated. 
```

Back to Stanley -- the "typewriter incident":

```markdown
A few months after Terry's second birthday, the Taos found him using a portable typewriter which stood 
in Dr. Tao's office; he had copied a whole page of a children's book laboriously with one finger! At 
this stage his parents decided that, although they did not want to 'push' their brilliant son, it would
be foolish to hold him back. They began to borrow and buy books for him and, indeed, found it hard to 
keep pace with the boy. They encouraged Terry to read and explore but were careful not to introduce him
to highly abstract subjects, believing, rather, that their task was to help him develop basic literacy
and numerical skills so that he could learn from books by himself and thus develop at his own rate. 
"Looking back," says Dr. Tao, "we are sure that it was this capacity for individual learning which helped
Terry to progress so fast without ever becoming bogged down by the inability to find a suitable tutor at
a crucial time." By the age of 3, Terry was displaying the reading, writing and mathematical ability of a
6-year-old.
```

Terry's parents get involved with the South Australian Association for Gifted and Talented Children (SAAGTC), a group of teachers and parents of gifted students who run Saturday programs for gifted children and seminars and workshops for parents and teachers:

```markdown
Here, for the first time, Terry was able to work and socialize with other highly gifted children. Although
he met no one sharing his own prodigious math ability (this is not surprising because in terms of IQ alone
he is, statistically, one in a million and the entire population of Australia is less than sixteen million)
he was able to mix with other children who shared his hunger for information, his ability to assimilate and
integrate abstract concepts, and his delight in creative exploration. Even within the accelerated context 
of SAAGTC programs, however, it was found necessary to accelerate Terry still further beyond his gifted 
age-mates. 

I vividly recall one of my first meetings with Terry when, in my capacity as President of SAAGTC, I was 
informally assessing his mathematical ability for placement in SAAGTC programs. At just under 4, he was 
multiplying 2-digit numbers by 2-digit numbers in his head while I, the 'tester', required pen and paper
to check his answers! Another image springs to mind of Terry, one month before his 5th birthday, working
with a group of gifted 7- to 9-year-olds at an SAAGTC math workshop. The teacher challenged the students
to find the next four numbers in the sequence 9182736. Terry thought briefly and responded, "4554." He
was, of course, correct. The number sequence consists of consecutive multiples of 9.
```

Terry's "Fibonacci" program, written in BASIC when he was 6:

```markdown
At home, Terry continued his advanced study in mathematics. By the age of 6, having taught himself BASIC
language (by reading a manual), he had written several computer programs on mathematics problems. He is
a lively, creative child with a puckish sense of humour; something of his personality comes over in the 
introduction to his "Fibonacci" program, which is quoted in full by Clements (1984).

8 print "J" (This symbol means "clear the screen") 
10 print "here comes mr. fibonacci"
20 print "can you guess which year was mr fibonacci born?" 
30 print "write down a number please . . . ": input c
31 if c = 1170 then print "you are correct; now we start!": go to 150 
50 if c > 1250 then print "no, he is already in heaven; try again": go to 30
60 if c < 1170 then print "sorry, he wasn't born yet!; try again": go to 30
70 if c > 1170 < 1250 then print "he would be c-1170 years old." 
71 print "now can you guess?"
The program goes on to produce all the Fibonacci numbers up to the level requested by the player.
```

First publication, at 8:

```markdown
At the age of 8 years 3 months Terry achieved his first publication, a BASIC program to calculate 
perfect numbers.
```

Social experience in high school -- see concluding remark:

```markdown
Terry adapted to Blackwood High, and Blackwood High to Terry, with little difficulty. John Fidge, his
Grade 11 math teacher, found that after the strangeness of the first 2 weeks he was accepted as just
another member of the class and regarded as a friendly, well-adjusted, helpful and good-natured lad
by his classmates (Clements, 1984). This, when one considers that Terry was, even at this early stage,
finishing his work two lessons before his 16-year-old classmates, says much for his social skills. He
is a delightful young boy who is aware that he is different but displays no conceit about his
remarkable gifts and has an unusual ability to relate to a wide range of people, from children younger
than himself to the university faculty members with whom he now works. Billy Tao believes that the two
years of 'riding' several classes each term at primary school laid the groundwork for his being able
to cope with much older students later.

An important factor in Terry's happy assimilation into high school was that, because of his extreme 
youth, he was not seen as a threat, either intellectually or socially, by the 16- and 17-year-olds with
whom he worked. He was visibly not in competition with them for jobs, scholarships, or boy-girl 
friendships; paradoxically, this allowed him to be treated as just another member of the class, with
the very occasional privilege of getting a piggy-back ride from teacher during bush-walking excursions!
"I am now convinced," says Dr. Tao, "that it is in fact easier to integrate a highly gifted child into
a higher grade in secondary school than a lower grade and Terry was lucky that he started math in 
Grade 11 instead of Grade 8."
```

The key event that made Terry's parents delay full-time university entrance:

```markdown
The question now before the family is: What direction should Terry take? There is little doubt that, 
if he chose to enter university full-time, he would graduate in mathematics before his 12th birthday.
(He would, incidentally, become the youngest person ever to do so; currently, the youngest graduate is
Jay Luo who took a degree at Boise State University, Idaho, at the age of 12 years 42 days.) Terry's 
IQ has been assessed as between 220 and 230, and he has no areas of academic weakness. Even in English
and social studies, which he considers his weaker subjects, he is working at a level 4 years above his
chronological age.

A number of factors have influenced the Tao family's thinking about Terry's future study. In September,
1984, at the age of 9, he was invited, with a small group of senior high school students, to compete in
an Australia-wide math competition to choose candidates to participate in the Australian Mathematical 
Olympiad. Despite being the youngest candidate by a margin of 5 years, he top-scored in South Australia 
and ranked sixth nationally. However, in the Australian Mathematical Olympiad, which was held 6 months 
later, he lost his sixth place and consequently was not selected for the Australian team which competed
in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Finland, in July, 1985.

The Taos feel there is an important message in this result. "Terry's development in Maths has been so 
fast," says Dr. Tao, "that like rapidly growing grass in fine weather, he has not had time to put down 
deep roots. When he was faced with really challenging work at a level he had not encountered before, 
that was when the weakness showed up. However, it is much kinder to Terry," he adds, "for him to 'fail'
within his own state rather than at the International Olympiad where he would have attracted a lot of
attention, even among the other competitors, because of his extreme youth."

In May, 1985, at the invitation of Julian Stanley, Terry and his parents spent 3 weeks in the United 
States, visiting a number of university campuses, including Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Princeton,
Berkeley, and Stanford, and talking with experts in mathematics and gifted education. This experience, 
the Taos say, has helped to clarify their thinking on Terry's future education.

Terry's parents now feel that he should probably wait at least 3 more years before he enters university
full-time.
```

His dad Billy explains further:

```markdown 
There is no need for him to rush ahead now. If he were to enter full-time now, just for the sake of 
being the youngest child to graduate, or indeed for the sake of doing anything 'first,' that would 
simply be a stunt. Much more important is the opportunity to consolidate his education, to build a 
broader base. It is important for Terry to have a broad initial education.

I can see two different models of how his education could progress. The first is what I might call a 
"columnar" model, where his acceleration would be directed vertically upwards in maths and physics with
little expansion into other areas of knowledge. The problem here is that, although progress may be fast
and easy at the beginning, as the column gets taller it becomes more difficult to build on further 
knowledge, and, to continue the metaphor, the taller the structure grows, the shakier it may become. 

The other model, which we have selected, is pyramidical in shape, where Terry's work in mathematics and
the sciences is integrated with many other areas of knowledge. Initial progress may be slowed down while
he explores the relationships between all these areas of study, but as the pyramid gains height it becomes
easier and faster and the whole structure rests on a sound base of interrelated knowledge.

This broad base of knowledge is essential. At the highest level of any subject the boundary between
science and arts, between mathematics and philosophy, becomes less and less distinct. You cannot
enter this highest level of sophistication if you are too specialized. Even in pure mathematics there 
will be many problems which you cannot answer simply by applying mathematical techniques. Take 
Einstein and the theory of relativity, for example; it is not so much mathematics as concepts beyond 
computation.
```

Even at 10, it was already totally evident that Terry was simply a wonderful human being:

```markdown
Terry as an individual is almost universally liked and admired by the teachers and students with whom 
he works. Having had the opportunity to study the development of his personality over the last 6 years, 
I am sure that this warmth and acceptance are largely due to the gentleness and modesty of Terry's 
nature. He is able to talk frankly and confidently to strangers as well as friends, but displays no 
arrogance or conceit. His parents have taught him not to posture but, at the same time, not to conceal
his ability. Unlike most profoundly gifted children, he seems to have no difficulty in relating to 
people of lesser ability (Hollingworth, 1942). He has no conception of himself as "better" than others,
merely different. To Terry everyone is of value, everyone has something to contribute.

Terry's motivation to excel, to discover and to create is a burning force in his life. The results of
his endeavours--the award, the prize, or whatever--are of much less importance to him than the delight
of intellectual speculation. Billy Tao tells of Terry's reaction to the news that he had achieved the 
highest score Stanley had ever found for a child of his age, on the SAT-M:

I asked him what he would like as a reward and he probably thought that was a more difficult question 
than the SAT itself! After a few seconds he asked for a piece of chocolate which had been in the
refrigerator for some time and was almost forgotten. When I gave it to him he broke it into two halves 
and gave one to me. He was delighted with the result, of course, but there was no great celebration or 
anything like that. He was more interested in going back to the physics book he was reading (B. Tao, 1985).
```

Terry's capacity to analyse and comment on his own intellectual growth and development is surprizing in one so young. During his visit to Purdue University he spoke to the faculty and graduate staff of the Gifted Education Resource Institute about his early experiences:

```markdown
A couple of years ago I sat for a state wide maths competition for the first time. I was given 2 hours
to do it but I finished in 20 minutes and spent the remaining time devising a method to find the value 
of pi. Afterwards, when Mum found out what I had done and asked me why I didn't spend more time on the 
competition and check my answers, I just said, 'Wait till I get a prize!' Needless to say, I didn't get
any prize and I was quite depressed for a while. Dad later discovered that most of my wrong answers
were due to arithmetical errors. After that episode, I learned that I should always time myself during
an exam and check my work. Unfortunately, I still don't attend to the latter very well!

I discovered I could learn better and remember more if I taught my brothers what I had learned. So I 
taught one brother chess and the other music. My music has never been very good--in fact I hated it 
until I gave myself the motivation to teach Trevor. Now I actually quite enjoy playing duets with him.
I spent a lot of my spare time working out interesting ways to teach them, and I probably learned more
from teaching them than they did from me (T. Tao, 1985)!
```

John F. Feldhusen remarks on Terry's curiosity:

```markdown 
I had dinner with Terry Tao and his parents recently and was struck by the intellectual intensity of
Terry and his parents. Throughout the dinner Dr. Tao's conversation centered on Terry's precocity and
conditions which would facilitate his intellectual growth. Meanwhile Terry interacted constantly with
his mother about puzzles and about little curiosity experiments he was doing at the table, such as
holding a spoon in a candle flame. I was told by another family whose home he visited that he had been
extremely active in exploring things around the house. He seems to have an ever active need to be 
investigating and learning.
```

Harry Passow's impressions:

```markdown
I was fortunate to have an opportunity to meet Terence Tao and to hear his father describe the discovery
and nurturing of this mathematical prodigy. As I listened to Terence's father, I focused on Terence. Here
was a very attractive, alert, intelligent, articulate child who had obviously heard his parents discuss 
him and his development many times before and who, while bored with the discussion, seemed very patient
to me. Several times I tried to provide him with advanced mathematics texts on which he might work but 
they were not of the right kind and he soon closed them and let his eyes wander about my library and
artifacts.

The Taos left two documents with me which I have read and reread. One is titled, "My Recollections" which
is Terence's recollections of his early childhood experiences and consists of as he puts it, "some memories
which are very dear to me, some are actually a bit embarrassing, some funny, but most rewarding." The 
second is a document titled, "Reflections on Terry's Education," which is a talk which Billy Tao gave. 
Both are fascinating documents: Terry's because it conveys to the readers an impression of a very
intelligent, very insightful, and very sensitive young person. Terry concludes his little presentation as
follows: "I may be labelled as an intelligent child by some of my teachers, but I still have a long way to
go yet before I can become as wise as anyone of you here today." I read this after Terence had left my
office--but I could hear him saying it, seriously and sincerely.

Billy Tao's discussion of his son's development and education concludes with what he calls "the danger 
areas ahead," possible scenarios of what could happen to Terry. These range from Terry's possibly becoming 
"too big-headed," to his losing "interest in one subject, such as maths, and want to study another, such
as rock music," to the possibility that "he may burn out completely and lose all his brilliance, creativity
and productivity." A fourth possibility suggested is that Terry "may suddenly think that he had been conned,
that all his hard work, his good marks, had all been carefully orchestrated so as to fulfill my (his 
father's) own personal ego."

In my office, I have a card which talks about "your ordinary, everyday, run-of-the-mill genius." Terence 
Tao may or may not become a mathematical genius. He is certainly a mathematically precocious child with 
unusual potential and achievement. Moreover, he is, if you will, a "nice kid." I worried about whether he
was being exploited by his parents. Having met Terence Tao and his parents, I no longer am worried. Those 
of us interested in gifted education and, in particular, the education of what one of my friends calls the
"severely and profoundly gifted," will find the Taos a fascinating family with three children — one
mathematically precocious and another with learning disabilities but all being raised and educated 
intelligently, sensitively, and reflectively.
```

Stanley muses on Terry's skewed scores:

```markdown
How could Terry possibly learn mathematics and physical and computer sciences so well with only 
290-380V development? We of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) at Johns Hopkins have
discovered, chiefly by testing able 12-year-olds, that when the examinee's SAT-M score vastly exceeds
his or her SAT-V score the youth is almost certain to score high on a difficult test of nonverbal
reasoning ability such as the Advanced Form of the Raven Progressive Matrices, often higher than a high-M 
high-V examinee does. To test this out, on 6 May 1985 I administered to Terry the RPM-Advanced, an untimed
test. He completed its 36 8-option items in about 45 minutes. Whereas the average British university
student scores 21, Terry scored 32. He did not miss any of the last, most difficult, 4 items. Also, when
told which 4 items he had not answered correctly, he was quickly able to find the correct response to each.
Few of SMPY's ablest protégés, members of its "700-800 on SAT-M Before Age 13" group, could do as well.

Excellent nonverbal reasoning ability seems a necessary, though almost surely not the sufficient, condition 
for excelling in mathematics of the algebra-geometry-trigonometry-calculus variety at an early age. The
test-triad of SAT-M, SAT-V, and RPM-Advanced can give considerable insight into a mathematically apt youth's
intellectual powers. To those three I would add appropriate spatial and mechanical reasoning tests. For 
youngsters whose total score on a general achievement test battery of the kind usually administered in 
schools is high (e.g., 90th percentile or greater on seventh-grade norms), the 8-part Differential Aptitude
Test battery of The Psychological Corporation in New York City may be a good place to start.

### LeBron James
([overview](#overview))

From Redditor xdawsonic on the thread [[Serious] How young of a LeBron would the average adult male be able to beat 1 on 1?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6huci7/serious_how_young_of_a_lebron_would_the_average/):

```markdown
I played against Lebron a handful of times when he was a Freshman, so I have a little experience 
in this area.

I'll relay my thoughts about the game I remember the most.

I was 18. A senior, decent athlete, a few D3 offers, a few "preferred walk on" for some D1 schools.
I was 6'3-6'4 and 180-190 pounds. He was 13-14 years old, and and near the same size as I was.. 
but enormous feet, long arms, but lanky. Probably weighed... 170?

I'll try to keep it somewhat short... I could hold my own against him, only because he was very, 
very raw. I feel my game was as polished as it could be, while he was still just getting things 
figured out. We both ended the game with similar stat lines, but the X factor was just the raw 
explosiveness and athleticism... something you honestly can't account for when talking about size,
weight and even age.

I'm sure alot of you have played basketball, maybe even lately.. but you know that first few 
possessions of the game? Sizing things up.. who can move, who can shoot, how are they guarding us....
Lebron was already on a different planet in terms of just sheer velocity. He could just get off of 
his feet, make a cut, or grab a rebound while I'm still flat footed. He didn't have springs in his 
legs.. he had trampolines. I had played against alot of tier 1 talent at that point at 5-Star and 
Blue Chip camps, but the odd thing is.. I knew IMMEDIATELY that this guy was something different..
and that isn't just hindsight.

Anyway, we lost that game by 6. Which ended up being their closest game of the year (applause? kappa)
... Lebron got a steal in the last 5 seconds to close the game.. and traveled the length of the court 
for the final "nail in the coffin" dunk. I was so pissed of.. he wasn't going to dunk on our home 
floor... I'm going to chase this FRESHMAN down and foul the hell out of him. Now.. I could jump, 
could dunk fairly easily.. so I figured... I can do this.. plus we are the same size.. what could
go wrong? So I get to him (he sort of took a wide approach angle), jump... andddd he's clearly a
foot above me at the apex. Easily a foot. I felt like Isiah in that Celtics series this year. I 
quickly decided to just do what I could, and just wailed on whatever part of his arms or head I
could reach. The dunk failed, so I guess it was a success... but it was just another lesson I 
realized that game. This man is far superior, and he hasn't even hit puberty yet. This is also one 
of those days when I decided to not play basketball in college. A rude awakening to just how good 
you have to be compete.

Anyway.. back to your question... St. V was good that year with alot of studs, so Lebron was 
considered "the next big thing", but everyone knew he was different. I first heard about him when he
was around 11 years old, and I know he was beating people up at the courts since at least that age.
It's also important to realize that Lebron had absolutely NO "puberty" stage of being uncoordinated,
or 'weak', or anything of the sort. Maverick (Lebron's cousin / business manager) used to say that
"he's the one to watch out for".. back when we were maybe 15-16 (Maverick was trying to steal my 
girlfriend, who went to St.V..... Mav if you are somehow reading this... what's good man?)...

..so that being said.. all I can say is.. athleticism and that 'god given' freak-of-nature, all-worldy
talent is just something you have to 'witness' to fully comprehend.
```

An exchange of comments between xdawsonic and other Redditors:

```markdown
you should absolutely puff your chest about it. Say "I blocked LeBron James multiple times" and have
it on your tombstone. It is a technically true statement.

I was moreso elaborating on the notion that age 13 was probably the year any "regular" guy had a 
punchers chance to compete with him.

Definitely "regular" in quotation marks. Division 3 offers and walk on status at D1 is pretty impressive,
and it was still a back and forth for you too(that's what I got from the post anyway).

As a 5-9 dude, I doubt I would be able to beat a 10 year old LeBron.
```

User ay21690 played Lebron in junior year, when he was on his way to the second of three consecutive Mr Ohio titles::

```markdown
We had the chance to play SVSM at a camp during the summer of his junior year. End of the camp is both
a single elimination tournament, then an expo where coaches picked a handful of the top players to run
a pick up game.

2nd round, we kept up with them for five minutes because zero defense was played. Now I'm 5'10", but I 
feel like I was pretty (keyword was) pretty quick. We decided to run a triangle and 2 against him on 
defense.

He literally laughed in our faces and scored every single time. I couldn't keep up with him. We lost by
42 points, that was only because he subbed out at halftime and Romeo Travis chucked 3s the rest of the game.
```

To which xdawsonic replied:

```markdown
I'm actually glad I got to play against 13-14 year old Lebron... and not THAT version. I actually think
he was scariest when he was Junior. He played incredibly hard. Senior year was a joke to him, I think.

I was in attendance for the Oak Hill vs. St. V game (Carmelo versus Lebron) that year... and I couldn't
fathom that I was watching the same guy.

Lebron had 36 that game, Carmelo had 34.
```

NintendoJesus adds perspective:

```markdown
Man, this brings me back. I played against 3 future NBA players in High School/College, Jason Gardner,
Wally Szczerbiak, and Melvin Levitt. 2 of them washed out of the NBA, and Wally wasn't exactly 1st team
NBA but I think he made an All Star game or 2 and had a good career. Gardner was the only one I played 
against in a real game, the rest were pick up games at Miami OH.

Unless you have played in a game vs a professional athlete, I don't think it's possible to understand 
how different they are from us normies. It's like they are a subspecies of human that have evolved into
something better. Like X-men or something. They don't play the same game as us. It's like if you played
against 5 year olds in a driveway with a 5 foot Fisher Price goal. You can't double them, you can't trap
them, you may as well not even be there.

And like you, I was good, not just like "back in the day" good, but like legit good. I'm 6'4", played 
point, could handle it, could shoot, could throw it off the board and dunk in my sleep. To a random
passerby, I probably looked like I could play. But no, I was an insect, Wally once scored 11 straight
on me 2 games in a row.(We played to 11, 1's and 2's) He was so strong that he could just pivot and 
shrug his shoulders and create enough space to do anything he wanted. It was like playing against your
dad when you're 5 years old.

They indirectly ended my basketball career. I knew I could never be what they were. No matter what I did.
And 2 of these guys didn't even make it in the NBA. I can't imagine playing against Lebron. He's from 
another planet.
```

Massive14:

```markdown
I went to watch him play a state tournament game in person during I believe LeBron's junior year. It
was a regional game at The University of Toledo. What stuck out the most was his extra gear. It always
felt like all the other kids were trying their hardest, but he was such a good athlete that he was 
walking when everyone else was running, and he was still dominating.

When he went into that extra gear though, my goodness. It was like watching a grown man against babies.
There's only a handful of athletes that I've ever seen in person that could flip the switch like that 
(Michael Bradley and Sidney Crosby to name a couple, but not as extreme).

### Ed Witten
([overview](#overview))

Ed Witten is famous for having a great turbine of a mind.

He kick-started the second superstring revolution essentially single-handedly, has the highest h-index of any living physicist (that said, h-index is obviously flawed – see e.g. [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index#Criticism) and [here](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/10/whats-wrong-with-the-predicting-h-index-paper/) and [here](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/2013/01/01/whats-wrong-with-citation-analysis/), although see [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/49/19193.abstract) for an argument that it still has better predictive power of future scientific achievement than other indicators considered), is the only physicist to ever win the Fields Medal, etc. Here are quotes about him I can quasi-procedurally recall (don’t remember them specifically, but I remember how to Google for them) right off the bat – and I haven’t even been reading about him for a while. Regardless of whether or not you agree, they’re definitely entertaining.

Mathwonk, in a physicsforum thread:

```markdown
Obviously Witten is a little smarter than the average bear.
```

John Randolph Huffman Professor of Physics at Yale [writing](http://www.eoht.info/thread/5126785/Edward+Witten?t=anon) of his experience of working with Witten:

```markdown
[O]ne day Ed Witten said to me, ‘I just learnt a new way to find exact S-matrices in two dimensions 
invented by Zamolodchikov and I want to extend the ideas to supersymmetric models. You are the 
S-matrix expert, aren’t you? Why don’t we work together?’ I was delighted. All my years of training
in Berkeley gave me a tremendous advantage over Ed—for an entire week.
```

Peter Baida, a close friend of Witten back in Park School (his high school):

```markdown
I suppose it’s common that kids in any high school sit around talking about who the smartest person
in the class is. But we used to sit around — when Edward wasn’t there — and talk about how he was the
smartest person in the world.
```

Michio Kaku (whose bio is really cool) in an [article](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/06/27/witten.physics/):

```markdown
I do believe there really is a category for a genius who is a supernova — a supernova that lights up 
the entire scientific landscape and that is Ed Witten…. I think he is as close as you are going to get
to a living Albert Einstein today.
```

Brian Greene:

```markdown
Everything I’ve ever worked on, if I trace its intellectual roots, I find they end at Witten’s feet.
```

“Max Raker”, commenting on the admittedly rather inane question “who’s the greater living genius, Terence Tao or Ed Witten?” in a [discussion thread](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/47/science-math-philosophy/greater-living-genius-terence-tao-ed-witten-663604/):

```markdown
So unlike most other people at his level, Witten didn’t really have scientific interests as an 
undergrad. The first time in which he officially had anything related to math/physics on his resume 
was when he started as a grad student at Princeton. I’m not even sure exactly how he got in, but i 
think within a few months he was working for David Gross. Gross was at this time likely the best physicist
in the world. Just before Witten joined his group, he had just finished some very important work on 
asymptotic freedom SU(3) and the strong interaction. This was work that he and his student, Frank Wilczek
later received a Nobel prize for.

So Gross was at the top of his game and also had good experience will gifted and Nobel prize worthy students.
Witten had a BS in History and had worked in politics. There are many stories you hear around Princeton 
about how frustrating Witten was to mentor. David would come up with a problem that he thought would take
anybody a few weeks to solve and require a ton of calculations, which a person sort of needs to go through 
to be educated as a theoretical physicist. Witten would instead come back in a day or 2 with a one page proof
that required no calculations and was based on some deep symmetry or other hidden but mathematically
sophisticated technique.

You can talk to some profs who were at Princeton at the time and as a school its produced its share of 
talent (including Tao) but I don’t think the faculty has ever been blown away like they were with Witten.
He must have had one of the quickest journeys from “I want to be a physicist” to “I am the most important
person in the field” in history.
```

Timothy Ferriss, in his book *The Whole Shebang*:

```markdown
In the high carrels of theoretical physics, where intelligence is taken for granted, Witten is regarded 
as preternaturally, almost forbiddingly, smart. A tall, boyish-looking man, he wears the habitual small 
smile of the theoretician for whom sustained mathematical thinking has something like the emotional
qualities that mystics associate with meditation. He speaks in a soft, high pitched voice, floating
short, precise sentences punctuated by witty little silences–the speech pattern of a man who has learned
that he thinks too fast to otherwise be understood. Though he is the son of a theoretical physicist,
Witten came to science in a roundabout fashion. He graduated from Brandeis College in 1971 as a history
major, wrote political journalism for the Nation and the New Republic, and worked in George McGovern’s
presidential campaign. Primarily a mathematician, he picked up physics along the way, almost as a hobby.
```

John H. Schwarz in an [article](http://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/13-the-man-who-led-the-second-superstring-revolution):

```markdown
Witten is both deep and fast: After thinking through the ideas, he can compose an essentially error-free
100-page manuscript, often describing breakthrough original research, on his computer in a day.

In 1987 Michael Green and I coauthored a monograph entitled “Superstring Theory’’ with Witten. We were 
thrilled that Witten agreed to join us, since we knew that his contributions would greatly improve the 
final product. This work, consisting of more than 1,000 pages packed with equations, was completed in
nine months. For Green and me this required dedicating 100-hour workweeks to the project. Witten, on 
the other hand, was able to do his share while completing several major research projects at the same time.
```

Nathan Seiberg:

```markdown
I think in perspective of a hundred years or three hundred years, his name will stay…. It will not be
forgotten — his contributions are really lasting — contributions which will stay there.

He combines the rigor and precision of a mathematician with intuition of a physicist. But what is
really remarkable about him is the clarity of his thinking.

He shows the direction for the rest of us…. His main strength is that he’s powerful in everything. Both
in math — the most sophisticated math — and physics … he has remarkable physics intuition as well as
complete control over the math that is needed. And, in that respect, I think he’s unique.
```

Michael Atiyah:

```markdown
Although he is definitely a physicist (as his list of publications clearly shows) his command of
mathematics is rivalled by few mathematicians, and his ability to interpret physical ideas in 
mathematical form is quite unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community by his
brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathematical theorems.
```

Atiyah says a bit more about how it was like to collaborate with Witten:

```markdown
I met him in Boston in 1977, when I was getting interested in the connection between physics and
mathematics. I attended a meeting, and there was this young chap with the older guys. We started
talking, and after a few minutes I realized that the younger guy was much smarter than the old guys.
He understood all the mathematics I was talking about, so I started paying attention to him. That 
was Witten. And I’ve kept in touch with him ever since.

In 2001, he invited me to Caltech, where he was a visiting professor. I felt like a graduate student
again. Every morning I would walk into the department, I’d go to see Witten, and we’d talk for an 
hour or so. He’d give me my homework. I’d go away and spend the next 23 hours trying to catch up.
Meanwhile, he’d go off and do half a dozen other things. We had a very intense collaboration. It was
an incredible experience because it was like working with a brilliant supervisor. I mean, he knew all
the answers before I got them. If we ever argued, he was right and I was wrong. It was embarrassing!
```

Keith Devlin on why Witten turning 50 is “worth celebrating”, paraphrased:

```markdown
Witten’s work in manifold theory brings up yet another comparison with Newton. Neither of them were
concerned with finding mathematically correct proofs to support their arguments. Relying on their 
intuitions and their immense ability to juggle complicated mathematical formulas, they both left
mathematicians reeling in their wake. It took over two hundred years for mathematicians to develop 
a mathematically sound theory to explain and support Newton’s method of the infinitesimal calculus.
Similarly, it might take decades — maybe even centuries — before mathematicians can catch up with Witten.

For most mathematicians, myself included, the only way to convince ourselves that something is true
in mathematics is to find a proof. A very small number of individuals, however, seem to be blessed 
with such deep and powerful insight that, guided by little else besides their intuitions and a sense
of “what is right”, they can cut through the logical thickets and discover the truth directly — 
whatever that means. Newton did it with calculus. The great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler did 
much the same thing with infinite sums in the eighteenth century. Arguably the Indian mathematician
Srinivasa Ramanujan did something similar with the arithmetical patterns of numbers he discovered. 
And now Witten is doing the same with infinite dimensional manifolds. On several occasions, Witten
has made a discovery — a physicist’s discovery since it is technically not a mathematical discovery 
— that mathematicians subsequently showed to be “correct” by the traditional means of formulating a
rigorous proof. Given the complexity of the “insights” that Newton, Euler, Ramanujan, and Witten have
made — and the difficulty of the subsequent proofs — this cannot be a case of making lucky guesses.
```

David Kahana, in [an answer to a question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Edward-Witten-know-so-much-math):

```markdown
In my opinion, Edward Witten had both an incredible working memory and an incredible long term memory
... it seemed that he already knew the solution of almost any solvable problem that was ever posed to him.

I had a friend who became his graduate student ... and Witten suggested a problem for him to work on. 

The poor guy worked for months, but made no real progress. Then he finally went to talk with Witten, 
who gave him  the solution immediately and in a short, and very simple way.

Genius can have a very nasty side.
```

The only non-effusive comment about him I've ever seen is this one:

```markdown
I don't think Witten is as strong a mathematician as a professional mathematician. Other than a proof
of Positive Energy theorem, I don't think Witten rigorously proved any mathematical statements. He
used the advance mathematics in his work, but Witten's genius is in seeing the connections. He showed
you can see knot invariants in as physical quantities in QFTs. Witten, with others, came up with some 
topological/symplectic invariants and these invariants arose as physical quantities in QFTs. They was
never rigorously defined and their properties were never proven in Witten's work. Which inspired some
mathematicians like Kontsevich to do wonders. 

He probably knows more maths than a smart beginning grad student in mathematics.
```

Robert Weisbrot [talks about](http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/2010/10/25/what-did-ed-witten-do-in-colle/) how Witten ended up in physics:

```markdown
I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had
been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that,
as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He
decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate 
school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out 
of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This
was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then
running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals 
like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him,
because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All
right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do?
Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, 
and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there–just after he had dropped
out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study
physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.
```

Ron Maimon on Witten's rise to prominence:

```markdown
He knew exactly what he was doing, politically and also physics. He was the first physics to understand 
the political lessons of the 1960s (and also the mathematics). Witten had a physicist father, a General 
Relativist, and this is where he made his early major, major breakthroughs (the positive mass theorem 
the bubbles of nothing Schwarzschild instanton, the gravitational compactifications of supergravity), 
he certainly knew General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics since high school, perhaps earlier, maybe in
middle school (once you learn calculus, some differential equations it’s easy enough to learn the rest 
in high school), he studied on his own (like almost every other decent physicist), especially mathematics,
in his college years, so he chose a bullshit major he could do in his sleep, but one he was genuinely 
interested in, because he GOT the politics of the 1960s, and he knew it was going to replace the staid 
Soviet/Eisenhower/De-Gaulle bureaucratic politics of the 1950s. He also just studied all the math he 
could, probably wanting to do pure math.

He did a bunch of politics and linguistics, but McGovern lost, and that meant it was going to be terrible
in the US for a while longer (nobody guessed how long). Physics in 1972 was still very politically
stagnant— the field was split in two, S-matrix and field theory, everyone was stoned and nobody was 
calculating anything (in Feynman’s words, from that era). Also, it had an atom-bomb stench, maybe that
was a factor, maybe not. It certainly was for others back then, who refused to study physics because of
the association with atomic bomb work.

Then in 1974 or so, it becomes clear this young Dutch guy named ‘t Hooft has renormalized gauge theory, 
and ‘t Hooft is producing monumental results left and right, on anomalies, instantons, new gauges, Feynman
diagram summations, 2-d models, everything. When he sees this (and he saw it for sure) Witten immediately 
switches fields. He applies to a graduate program in applied mathematics where he knows David Gross is
active (he has a plan), goes over to David Gross and talks physics to him, at which point Gross arranges 
for him to switch departments, and Witten is considered a phenom, because he already knows everything 
(it was a stupid trick in the print era– if you just read the literature, and you look like a genius— he 
was also a genius though).

Then he gets a PhD under Gross (who is by this time very famous, Gross knows S-matrix theory, he studied 
under Chew, but he is also a major leader in field theory, after asymptotic freedom, plus he knows 
condensed matter and does 2d stuff too, all things Witten expertly absorbed). He gets a job on the East 
Coast, at Harvard, where S-matrix and strings are taboo. Then he collaborates with all the big shots, 
Venziano, Coleman, and so on. Coleman is impressed to no end, and starts studying gravitational things 
in this era. (Witten is also doing great solo work at this point, like the nonabelian bosonization), and
the endless schmoozing and obvious talent and knowledge pushes his h-index to the roof.

Then he goes to Princeton, where he switches and supports string theory, bringing every other marginalized
voice up from the gutter, and now he is ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHABLE, politically, he is Albert Einstein. One 
cannot thank him enough for this, it was the most important political move in physics history, and that’s
not an exaggeration. He also does amazing work to push string theory forward from this point on, 
formulating open string field theory, finding realistic compactifications, and finding subtle physical
consequences of string theory which would give possible observational signatures. He also does amazing work
in all fields of high energy physics, and has pure mathematics breakthroughs.
```

Another Ronnism:

```markdown
Witten has contributed extremely significantly to mathematics, but so did Candlin with the Berezin 
integral, and so did Berezin with the proto-SUSY, and most significantly Pierre Ramond, who created
graded algebras. You can’t forget Ramond. And Belavin, Polyakov, Zamolodchikov and Knizhnik, who 
quadruple-handedly founded one of the most active fields of mathematics. Witten too, and Witten’s
contributions are closer to the center of what mathematicians find interesting, but you see how the
stupid politics gets in the way— he is praised so much, you can’t praise him as he deserves without
feeling you are neglecting other people.

The problem with mathematics is that the evaluation of quality is often by human judgement, not by
nature, and that can lead to politics too. That’s also somewhat true in physics, but physicists have
ways to get around that, by doing experiments, or by pretending to do certain experiments and then
breaking our head to come up with an answer as to what happens. The mathematicians have their own 
“though experiment” solution benchmarks, these are famous conjectures.

Witten solved many interesting mathematical problems of great depth, and also formulated and solved
many physical problems (one of my favorite works of his is the superconducting cosmic string paper 
from the mid 80s, another is a failed paper to try to solve the cosmological constant problem from 
the 90s, failed, but he gave it a major creative inspirational shot).

But stop trying to rank people on a line, it’s really stupid.
```

Ron on how Witten "knows so much math":

```markdown
Researchers are expected to learn the stuff they need, and be familiar with everything. Since this
is somewhat unrealistic, it just means you try to keep up all the time, and nobody feels they know
enough, you always feel like you're missing something.

Witten came before the internet, and one cannot overestimate how much more difficult it was to study
mathematics back then. When you opened a math book, if you didn't know the definitions, you couldn't
google them, you were just screwed. He studied mathematics (among other things) as an undergraduate,
I remember he was grateful for the proper mathematics education he recieved, but he continued to read
mathematics and internalize it also as a grad student and through his post doc and into his 
professorial career. He said he considered going into mathematics at one point, also perhaps
linguistics at some other point. He was a young lefty in the 1960s, there were a bunch of exciting 
things to do, but he eventually decided that physics was where he would make the biggest impact. He 
was up to date on the mathematics of the 1960s, that's extremely unusual for a pre-Witten physicist.
Now, it's expected, but it's expected mostly because of Witten!

All physicists know the elementary mathematics curriculum, that's no big trick. Most physicists have
mathematical competence in the areas related to their chosen field, to the level of a beginning
researcher. But what makes Witten special is his deep intuitive understanding of ALL fields of 
mathematics, especially deeply the 1960s topology stuff, that he clearly just learned for the heck of 
it, it wasn't before useful in physics, all the homology, homotopy theory and algebraic geometry 
constructions mathematicians were doing back then. It became central with string theory.

For example, one of his famous works in the 1990s was a note identifying the structure of brane anti-
brane annihilation as a type of K-theory, which is a Grothendieck construction which didn't have a 
physical intepretation before, nor is it something you would expect any physicist would know about.
Witten is the exception, because he knows the mathematics field as well as any mathematician, and he
just likes the material, he reads it, and rediscovers large chunks for himself.

While it is not polite to speculate about people who are alive (you can just ask them), I suspect he
learned a large chunk of advanced mathematics during his Harvard postdoc, in the late 1970s. Jaffe
and Coleman are influenced by him, probably the influence goes both ways, Coleman begins doing 
topological instantons, then he did the vacuum decay work, the false-vacuum instanton thing which was 
so influential for inflation theory. Witten is also associated with two enormous Harvard pure-
mathematics names, Bott and Yau. His mathematics had a Harvard feel to it, the 1985 Calabi Yau paper,
the Morse theory paper, these are popular Harvard topics.

He won a fields medal, and this is for a beautiful interpretation of the Jones knot polynomial from
large N 3d topological Chern-Simons gauge theory, a theory that he defined. In another related idea,
just a few years ago, he showed with his student or postdoc that the volume  conjecture (due to 
Thurston I think) is related to a property of these  topological theories under analytic continuation, 
and modulo the standard problem of precisely defining the path integral, they gave what should be a 
proof of the conjecture. He has a bunch of recent mathematical work I couldn't understand at all
related to pure algebraic geometry.

He also has a bunch of non-mathematical physics work too which are famous classics, like the
superconducting cosmic strings, the bubble of nothing instantons, the Witten anomaly, the Seiberg 
Witten theory and brane-stack constructions, the AdS/CFT constructions, a bunch more I probably forgot.
One thing that is not considered a classic is a 1992 or 1993 cone idea about supersymmetry breaking
that is very clever and simple idea for stabilizing the cosmological constant, but it probably doesn't
work (there seems to be a mistake, I don't remember what I thought it was), but boy is it inspirational.
it's really intimidating, as all his work is of extremely high quality, and everything is for sure 
required reading. It is a little difficult to follow, because it requires knowing earlier physical and
mathematical work, but it's as if it was made for the age of the internet, because now you can learn 
the associated material without being in a fancy place.
```

Ed Witten talking about himself sounds much more relatable. Consider these excerpts from [this interview for the AMS Notices](http://www.ams.org/notices/201505/rnoti-p491.pdf):

```markdown
....in those years, I knew about Khovanov homology and I was frustrated to not understand it, but I
had no idea it was related to geometric Langlands. I was frustrated at not understanding Khovanov 
homology, because I felt that my work on the Jones polynomial ought to be a good starting point for 
understanding Khovanov homology, but I just could not see how to proceed.

Eventually, however, some developments in the mathematical literature helped me understand that 
Khovanov homology should be understood using the same ingredients that are used to understand geometric
Langlands. I didn’t understand all of these clues, but I learned from two of them. .... I did not 
initially know what to make of those clues, but they were a sort of red flag hanging out there.
```

Or this:

```markdown
If one knows even a little bit about the Langlands correspondence and a little bit about conformal field theory on a Riemann surface, one can see an analogy between them. I wrote a paper that was motivated by that, but then I realized that my understanding was too superficial to lead to anything deep, so I abandoned the matter for a number of years.
```

Or this:

```markdown
The work of Beilinson and Drinfeld on geometric Langlands bothered me.... They were using familiar ingredients of physics, but they were using them in ways that did not seem to fit. It looked like somebody had taken a bunch of chess pieces, or perhaps here in Japan I should say a bunch of shogi pieces, and placed them on the board at random. The way that the pieces were arranged did not make any sense to me. That bothered me, but I could not do anything about it.
```

Or this:

```markdown
Although I understood scarcely anything of what Beilinson and Drinfeld were saying, I did put them in touch with Hitchin’s work, and actually, in their very long, unpublished foundational paper on geometric Langlands that you can find on the Web, Beilinson and Drinfeld acknowledged me very generously, far overestimating how much I had understood. All that had really happened was that based on a guess, I told them about Hitchin’s work, and then I think that made all kinds of things obvious to them. Maybe they felt I knew some of those things, but I didn’t.
```

Or this:

```markdown
There were two long series of lectures and then there were a couple of outliers. The long series were very well done, but they did not help me very much.

In addition, Ed Frenkel.... gave a series of lectures that, as far as I was concerned, were basically about the shogi board on which the pieces have been arranged at random. I really couldn’t get much out of those lectures either, because I already knew that people working on the geometric Langlands were taking familiar pieces from the shogi set and arranging them on the board at random as far as I was concerned.
```

Or this:

```markdown
I personally concentrated on geometric Langlands rather than on number theory, and geometric Langlands was hard enough..... For example, I did not understand what Hiraku Nakajima explained yesterday at the Kyoto Prize Workshop.
```

Or this:

```markdown
In some cases, I am still struggling to understand things that physicists did quite some time ago that are very relevant. Just to give one example, the Gopakumar-Vafa and Ooguri-Vafa formulas have been very influential for algebraic geometers, but as a physicist, I was never satisfied that I understood them. So I actually spent a lot of time in the last year with a student (Mykola Dedushenko) trying to understand these formulas better. In this work, I was doing some of the homework that I’d have to understand before even trying to answer your question.
```

Or this, as a counterpoint to Seiberg's claim that he's "powerful in everything.... [including] the most sophisticated math":

```markdown
Usually producing rigorous proofs requires very detailed methods. That makes it hard for a physicist, and so I myself have only done that in very special cases where I thought something was really missing that was actually simple enough that I could help do it if I had the right collaborator.

### Critique of Freakonomics
([overview](#overview))

From Daniel Davies' [review](https://blog.danieldavies.com/2005_11_27_d-squareddigest_archive.html#113336769665072876). The chief problem is "the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers":

```markdown
There are a number of things I don't like about Levitt's approach, but the biggest problem I have with
him is his[2] habit of saying (in various forms of words) "whichever way you look at the numbers, XYZ" 
when he means "whichever way I look at the numbers, XYZ". On a lot of these subjects (by far the most 
obvious example is abortion/crime, but it is an issue in all of them to a greater or lesser degree), 
Levitt is looking at quite large, clearly multicausal issues where any model is likely to be partial and
all manner of conflicting theories can claim support from the data. "Freakonomics" absolutely does not
recognize this fundamental truth of econometrics; it might be because the authors don't have the 
statistical chops to understand it but I think it is much more likely that they are just trying to copy 
the monolithic tone of voice adopted by social reformers and similar blowhards who hand out their 
assertions with no data at all. In all honesty, I think that theL&D approach is a retrograde step; it's
easy for the untrained reader to spot when someone has no empirical support at all for his position, but
much more difficult to deal with someone who systematically overstates the empirical support that he does
have. This is at least 90% of what makes John Lott so pernicious, and it seems to me that L&D are involved
at least partly in the same sort of game.

It's the game of pretending that difficult social questions have easy non-sociological answers. There are 
lots of people in this space, and not all of it is by any means bad. Any look at a difficult question is
going to be either hopelessly oversimplified or hopelessly unreadable, and I would certainly prefer it if
people erred in the first direction. There's also a decent Hayekian (or indeed Bayesian) point to be made
here that if you're entering into the marketplace of ideas to try and extract the truth from a number of 
differing viewpoints, then you want everyone to give you their idea, not to caveat it all about with bits 
and pieces of other people's ideas. That's why I'm prepared to give a (limited) free pass to Malcolm Gladwell 
or James Surowiecki when they write books like this which, in my view, present absurdly oversimplified views
of the world, because I understand what they're trying to do; to present their view on a question, not to 
give the final indisputable answer.

The problem comes in when someone attempts to present their view of a question as if it is the final
indisputable answer. A lot of the things in Freakonomics are things that I wouldn't make too much of a fuss
about if the authors were just advancing them as their view of one way of explaining the facts. But they
don't do that; at key points in the book, they keep claiming that they're reporting the facts when they're 
clearly (to me at least) reporting a particular spin on the facts. This is the pop-science approach to social
questions, because it's trying to combine the authority of a scientific investigation with the unequivocal 
certainty of a theoretical pronouncement. What Levitt and Dubner are doing is exactly the same thing that 
Thomas Friedman does; telling a bunch of stories and then explaining how these stories fit into their view of 
the world. However, in the case of Friedman it's always obvious that someone else could tell entirely
different stories about the same kinds of people and events and fit them into an entirely different worldview.
Because of the way that Freakonomics has pitched itself at the pop-science crowd (constantly banging on about
Levitt's John Bates Clark medal and referring to all the statistical analyses; for fans of cringeworthy 
exegesis, page 161 of the American edition contains what I strongly believe to be the worst description of the 
linear regression model ever committed to print), however, they are always either implying or outright saying
that their stories are the only ones consistent with the facts, so we can either fit their stylized facts into 
our own worldview or (preferably) drop ours and buy theirs. As you can tell, I don't like this.
```

Example Freakonomism: "the typical prostitute earns more than the typical architect". Davies says:

```markdown
This remark is asinine. What on earth are they talking about? There is probably a reasonable working 
definition of a "typical architect" (though I can think of about five different types of architect off 
the top of my head), but what is a "typical prostitute"? Do they mean per hour or on an average annual
earnings basis? Is there any data to back this up (the only study I could find put average earnings for 
street prostitutes in Los Angeles, who are about as "typical" as any other prostitutes at $23485 in 1991,
which seems low for an architect)? 

Fair enough, this is really just a throwaway remark aimed at illustrating a point about labour market 
theory, but surely the whole freakonomicsing selling point of this book was meant to be that the authors
didn't make lazy assumptions and throwaway remarks but checked things against the data. I'm sorry, but if
a bloke says "of course, prostitutes make a mint, they do, they earn much more than you or I", then in my
estimation it is going to count very much against his subsequent claim to never take things on trust or 
to tirelessly question conventional wisdom.
```

Another example, concerning swimming pools and guns:

```markdown
As presented in the book, the argument is obviously wrong. Levitt divides the number of child deaths 
caused by guns by the number of guns, then divides the number of child deaths caused by swimming pools 
by the number of swimming pools, compares the two numbers and says "if you have a gun in your house and
a swimming pool, the pool is more likely to kill your child than the gun". 

Which might or might not be true, but this calculation can't possibly be the right way to prove it. Riddle
me this; what proportion of the guns in the USA are held in households with no children in them? What
proportion of the swimming pools in the US are owned by households with no children in them? Is there 
perhaps a pretty good reason to believe that households which differ in their gun ownership and 
swimming-pool ownership will also differ in other potentially relevant ways? Is there a good reason to 
believe that the fact that a house has a child in it will be informative about the relative likelihood of
gun ownership and pool ownership? Now, Levitt might, for all I know, have actually done the more rigorous
analytic work which would support his claim here. But if he did, I bet he did it in a proper journal where
he stated the claim with the proper caveats and was totally clear about the degree of confidence that could 
be placed in it. But that's not what he does in "Freakonomics". He just a) puts the factoid straight in 
front of the reader with no qualifications at all and b) backs it up with a calculation that is clearly
flat out wrong. He's simultaneously teaching the lay reader to make definitive statements without
acknowledging estimation problems, and to ignore correlations between explanatory variables. How on earth 
can this not be worsening the overall level of debate?

### Expert judgment
([overview](#overview))

Cosma Shalizi [compares clinical and actuarial judgment](http://bactra.org/notebooks/clinical-vs-actuarial.html), and finds something confusing; this also throws a wrench in my usual "experts suck at prediction" POV:

```markdown
For something like fifty years now, psychologists have been studying the question of 
"clinical versus actuarial judgment".

The idea goes like this. Say you're interested in diagnosing heart diseases from 
electrocardiograms. Normally we have clinicians, i.e., expert doctors, look at a chart and say
whether the patient has (to be definite) a heart condition requiring treatment within one year. 

Alternately, we could ask the experts what features they look at, when making their prognosis, 
and then fit a statistical model to that data, trying to predict the outcome or classification 
based on those features, which we can still have human experts evaluate. This is the actuarial
approach, since it's just based on averages --- "of patients with features x, y and z, q percent
have a serious heart condition".

The rather surprising, and completely consistent, result of these studies is that there are no 
known cases where clinicians reliably out-perform actuarial methods, even when the statistical 
models are just linear classification rules, i.e., about as simple a model as you can come up 
with. In many areas, statistical classifiers significantly out-perform human experts. They even 
out-perform experts who have access to the statistical results, apparently because the experts 
place too much weight on their own judgment, and not enough on the statistics. Whether you think
this is depressing news or not to some degree depends on your feelings about "clinical" experts.
So: human experts are really bad, or at least no better than simple statistical models.

On the other hand, there is *another* body of experimental work, admittedly more recent, on "simple
heuristics that make us smart", which seems to show that people are often *very good* judges, *under
natural conditions*. That is to say, we're very good at solving the problems we tend to actually 
encounter, presented in the way we encounter them. The heuristics we use to solve those problems
may not be *generally* applicable, but they are *adapted* to our environments, and, in those
environments, are fast, simple and effective.
```

How to reconcile this apparent contradiction? Cosma proposes three different ways; he doesn't know which is best:

```markdown
1. The "clinicial versus actuarial" results are wrong, or at least irrelevant. The experiments
do not reflect the "natural" conditions of clinical judgment. There are many possibilities here,
but the one which springs immediately to mind is that clinicians may not actually have much insight
into the way they *really* make decisions, and that the factors they think they attend to may not 
really be the ones that matter to them. What one really wants is a representative sample of actual
cases, comparing the normal judgment of clinicians to that of the statistical models. This may 
have been done; I don't know.

2. The "fast and frugal heuristics" results are wrong, or at least irrelevant. Whatever adaptive
mechanisms let us figure out good heuristics in everyday life don't apply in the situations where 
we rely on clinical expertise, or at least not in a lot of them. (See, for instance, the discussion
of projective tests like the Rorsharch ink-blots in Holland et al.'s Induction.) The problem can't
just be that we didn't evolve to make psychiatric diagnoses, since we didn't evolve to do most of
the diagnostic/prognostic tasks the fast-and-frugal-heuristics experiments show we can do, presumably
by expating the mechanisms that let our ancestors answer questions like "Just how angry will my
neighbors be if they catch me fishing in their stream?". There has to be something special about the
conditions of clinicial judgment that render our normal cognitive mechanisms ineffective there.

3. Clinicial judgment *is* a "fast and frugal heuristic", with emphasis on the fast and frugal. That is,
it is true that (e.g.) linear classifiers are more *accurate*, but the decision procedures clinicians 
are using may be as accurate as one can get, using only a reasonable amount of information and a
reasonable amount of time, while still using the human brain, which is not a computing platform 
well-suited to floating-point operations. The problem here is that there are areas where clinicians 
do seem to do as well as statistical methods.

### Signaling

<a name="#x-isnt-about-y"></a>
### X isn't about Y
([overview](#overview))

The founding document for this slogan is Robin Hanson's post [Politics isn't about policy](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html). 

Main thesis:

```markdown
Food isn’t about Nutrition
Clothes aren’t about Comfort
Bedrooms aren’t about Sleep
Marriage isn’t about Romance
Talk isn’t about Info
Laughter isn’t about Jokes
Charity isn’t about Helping
Church isn’t about God
Art isn’t about Insight
Medicine isn’t about Health
Consulting isn’t about Advice
School isn’t about Learning
Research isn’t about Progress
Politics isn’t about Policy

The above summarizes much of my contrarian world view.  (What else should go on this list?) 
When I say “X is not about Y,” I mean that while Y is the function commonly said to drive most 
X behavior, in fact some other function Z drives X behavior more.
```

Politics example from the post:

```markdown
High school students are easily engaged to elect class presidents, even though they have little 
idea what if any policies a class president might influence.  Instead such elections are usually
described as “popularity contests.”  That is, theses elections are about which school social 
factions are to have higher social status.  If a jock wins, jocks have higher status.  If your
girlfriend’s brother wins, you have higher status, etc.  And the fact that you have a vote says
that others should take you into account when forming coalitions – you are somebody.


Civics teachers talk as if politics is about policy, that politics is our system for choosing 
policies to deal with common problems.  But as Tyler Cowen suggests, real politics seems to be 
more about who will be our leaders, and what coalitions will rise or fall in status as a result.  
Election media coverage focuses on characterizing the candidates themselves – their personalities,
styles, friends, beliefs, etc.  You might say this is because character is a cheap clue to the
policies candidates would adopt, but I don’t buy it.

The obvious interpretation seems more believable – as with high school class presidents, we care
about policies mainly as clues to candidate character and affiliations.  And to the extent we
consider policies not tied to particular candidates, we mainly care about how policies will effect
which kinds of people will be respected how much.

For example, we want nationalized medicine so poor sick folks will feel cared for, military actions
so foreigners will treat us with respect, business deregulation as a sign of respect for hardworking
businessfolk, official gay marriage as a sign we accept gays, and so on.

This perspective explains why voters tend to prefer proportional representation, why many refuse to
vote for any candidate when none have earned their respect, and why so few are interested in
institutional reforms that would plausibly give more informed policies.

### Countersignaling
([overview](#overview))

My go-to reference for countersignaling is Scott Alexander's [Intellectual Hipsters and Meta-Contrarianism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kcTNWopvXFncXgPy/intellectual-hipsters-and-meta-contrarianism). Key quote from the introduction:

```markdown
In certain situations refusing to signal can be a sign of high status. Thorstein Veblen invented
the term "conspicuous consumption" to refer to the showy spending habits of the nouveau riche,
who unlike the established money of his day took great pains to signal their wealth by buying fast
cars, expensive clothes, and shiny jewelery. Why was such flashiness common among new money but not
old? Because the old money was so secure in their position that it never even occurred to them that
they might be confused with poor people, whereas new money, with their lack of aristocratic breeding, 
worried they might be mistaken for poor people if they didn't make it blatantly obvious that they had
expensive things.

The old money might have started off not buying flashy things for pragmatic reasons - they didn't need
to, so why waste the money? But if F. Scott Fitzgerald is to be believed, the old money actively
cultivated an air of superiority to the nouveau riche and their conspicuous consumption; not buying 
flashy objects becomes a matter of principle. This makes sense: the nouveau riche need to differentiate 
themselves from the poor, but the old money need to differentiate themselves from the nouveau riche.

This process is called countersignaling, and one can find its telltale patterns in many walks of life.
Those who study human romantic attraction warn men not to "come on too strong", and this has similarities
to the nouveau riche example. A total loser might come up to a woman without a hint of romance, promise
her nothing, and demand sex. A more sophisticated man might buy roses for a woman, write her love poetry,
hover on her every wish, et cetera; this signifies that he is not a total loser. But the most desirable 
men may deliberately avoid doing nice things for women in an attempt to signal they are so high status 
that they don't need to. The average man tries to differentiate himself from the total loser by being nice;
the extremely attractive man tries to differentiate himself from the average man by not being especially 
nice.

In all three examples, people at the top of the pyramid end up displaying characteristics similar to 
those at the bottom. Hipsters deliberately wear the same clothes uncool people wear. Families with old
money don't wear much more jewelry than the middle class. And very attractive men approach women with 
the same lack of subtlety a total loser would use.
```

And here's metacontrarians as "intellectual hipsters":

```markdown
A person who is somewhat upper-class will conspicuously signal eir wealth by buying difficult-to-obtain
goods. A person who is very upper-class will conspicuously signal that ey feels no need to conspicuously 
signal eir wealth, by deliberately not buying difficult-to-obtain goods. 

A person who is somewhat intelligent will conspicuously signal eir intelligence by holding difficult-to-
understand opinions. A person who is very intelligent will conspicuously signal that ey feels no need to
conspicuously signal eir intelligence, by deliberately not holding difficult-to-understand opinions.

...just as contrarians risk becoming too contrary, moving from "actually, death has a few side benefits" to 
"DEATH IS GREAT!", meta-contrarians are at risk of becoming too meta-contrary.

All the possible examples here are controversial, so I will just take the least controversial one I can
think of and beg forgiveness. A naive person might think that industrial production is an absolute good
thing. Someone smarter than that naive person might realize that global warming is a strong negative to 
industrial production and desperately needs to be stopped. Someone even smarter than that, to differentiate
emself from the second person, might decide global warming wasn't such a big deal after all, or doesn't 
exist, or isn't man-made.

In this case, the contrarian position happened to be right (well, maybe), and the third person's meta-
contrariness took em further from the truth. I do feel like there are more global warming skeptics among 
what Eliezer called "the atheist/libertarian/technophile/sf-fan/early-adopter/programmer empirical cluster
in personspace" than among, say, college professors.

In fact, very often, the uneducated position of the five year old child may be deeply flawed and the 
contrarian position a necessary correction to those flaws. This makes meta-contrarianism a very dangerous
business. 

Remember, most everyone hates hipsters.

Without meaning to imply anything about whether or not any of these positions are correct or not3, the
following triads come to mind as connected to an uneducated/contrarian/meta-contrarian divide:

- KKK-style racist / politically correct liberal / "but there are scientifically proven genetic differences"
- misogyny / women's rights movement / men's rights movement
- conservative / liberal / libertarian4
- herbal-spiritual-alternative medicine / conventional medicine / Robin Hanson
- don't care about Africa / give aid to Africa / don't give aid to Africa
- Obama is Muslim / Obama is obviously not Muslim, you idiot / Patri Friedman5

What is interesting about these triads is not that people hold the positions (which could be expected by 
chance) but that people get deep personal satisfaction from arguing the positions even when their arguments
are unlikely to change policy6 - and that people identify with these positions to the point where arguments
about them can become personal.

If meta-contrarianism is a real tendency in over-intelligent people, it doesn't mean they should immediately
abandon their beliefs; that would just be meta-meta-contrarianism. It means that they need to recognize the
meta-contrarian tendency within themselves and so be extra suspicious and careful about a desire to believe 
something contrary to the prevailing contrarian wisdom, especially if they really enjoy doing so.

One more time: the fact that those beliefs are in an order does not mean some of them are good and others 
are bad. For example, "5 year old child / pro-death / transhumanist" is a triad, and "warming denier /
warming believer / warming skeptic" is a triad, but I personally support 1+3 in the first triad and 2 in 
the second. You can't evaluate the truth of a statement by its position in a signaling game; otherwise you 
could use human psychology to figure out if global warming is real!
```

Commenter Emile cautions that "going meta" can be dangerous:

```markdown
It's possible to go meta on nearly any issue, and there are a lot of meta-level arguments - group 
affiliation, signaling, rationalization, ulterior motives, whether a position is contrarian or supported
by the majority, who the experts are and how much we should trust them, which group is persecuted the most,
straw man positions and whether anybody really holds them, slippery slopes, different ways to interpret
statements, who is working under which cognitive bias ...

Which is why I prefer discussions to stick to the object level rather than go meta. It's just too easy to
rationalize a position in meta, and to find convincing-sounding arguments as to why the other side mistakenly
disagrees with you. And meta-level disagreements are more likely to persist in the long run, because they are
hard to verify.

Sure, meta-level arguments are very valuable in many cases, we shouldn't drop them altogether. But we should
be very cautious while using them.

### Augmenting long-term memory
([overview](#overview))

From Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), which is an all-around great essay you should read in its entirety. One of its theses:

```markdown
Many people treat memory ambivalently or even disparagingly as a cognitive skill: for instance,
people often talk of “rote memory” as though it's inferior to more advanced kinds of understanding.
I'll argue against this point of view, and make a case that memory is central to problem solving 
and creativity.
```

To expand on his point:

```markdown
It's a mistake to underestimate the importance of memory. I used to believe such tropes about the 
low importance of memory. But I now believe memory is at the foundation of our cognition.

There are two main reasons for this change, one a personal experience, the other based on evidence
from cognitive science.

Let me begin with the personal experience.

Over the years, I've often helped people learn technical subjects such as quantum mechanics. Over 
time you come to see patterns in how people get stuck. One common pattern is that people think 
they're getting stuck on esoteric, complex issues. But when you dig down it turns out they're having 
a hard time with basic notation and terminology. It's difficult to understand quantum mechanics when
you're unclear about every third word or piece of notation! Every sentence is a struggle.

It's like they're trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in French, but only know 200 words of French.
They're frustrated, and think the trouble is the difficulty of finding a good theme, striking 
sentiments and images, and so on. But really the issue is that they have only 200 words with which to
compose.

My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less 
about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves.

But while I held this as a strong conviction about other people, I never realized it also applied to
me. And I had no idea at all how strongly it applied to me. Using Anki to read papers in new fields 
disabused me of this illusion. I found it almost unsettling how much easier Anki made learning such 
subjects. I now believe memory of the basics is often the single largest barrier to understanding. If
you have a system such as Anki for overcoming that barrier, then you will find it much, much easier 
to read into new fields.

This experience of how much easier Anki made learning a new technical field greatly increased my 
visceral appreciation for the importance of memory.

<a name="#procedural-vs-declarative-memory"></a>
### Procedural vs declarative memory
([overview](#overview))

From Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), talking about procedural vs declarative memory in the context of using Anki flashcards:

```markdown
There's a big difference between remembering a fact and mastering a process. For instance, while 
you might remember a Unix command when cued by an Anki question, that doesn't mean you'll recognize
an opportunity to use the command in the context of the command line, and be comfortable typing it 
out. And it's still another thing to find novel, creative ways of combining the commands you know, 
in order to solve challenging problems.

Put another way: to really internalize a process, it's not enough just to review Anki cards. You need
to carry out the process, in context. And you need to solve real problems with it.
```

From Alicorn's LW post [The Great Brain is Located Externally](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h7NkpER4Jo8BLWgPD/the-great-brain-is-located-externally):

```markdown
Propositional knowledge is being gradually supplanted by the procedural.  You need only know *how to find*
information, to be able to use it after a trivial delay.  This requires some snippet of propositional data
- to find a song lyric, you need a long enough string that you won't turn up 99% noise when you try to 
Google it! - but mostly, it's a skill, not a fact, that you need to act like you knew the fact.

It's not clear to me whether this means that we should be alarmed and seek to hone our factual memories...
or whether we should devote our attention to honing our Google-fu, as our minds gradually become
server-side operations.

### External brain 
([overview](#overview))

Aids to memory have been opposed for millennia. Here's Socrates, in Plato's Phaedrus, circa 370 BCE, bemoaning the deleterious effects of the new technology of "writing":

```markdown
If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise
memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer 
from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe 
not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but
only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make 
them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with
wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.
```

Alicorn's LW post [The Great Brain is Located Externally](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h7NkpER4Jo8BLWgPD/the-great-brain-is-located-externally) and the comments are great. It's from 2009; a decade hence, they're more applicable than ever. Here's some neat quotes.

```markdown
How many of the things you "know" do you have memorized?

Do you remember how to spell all of those words you let the spellcheck catch?  Do you remember
what fraction of a teaspoon of salt goes into that one recipe, or would you look at the list of
ingredients to be sure?  Do you remember what kinds of plastic they recycle in your neighborhood,
or do you delegate that task to a list attached with a magnet to the fridge?

If I asked you what day of the month it is today, would you know, or would you look at your
watch/computer clock/the posting date of this post?

Before I lost my Palm Pilot, I called it my "external brain".  It didn't really fit the description; 
with no Internet access, it mostly held my contact list, class schedule, and grocery list.  And a 
knockoff of Minesweeper.  Still, in a real enough sense, it remembered things for me.The vast arena 
of knowledge at our fingertips in the era of constant computing has, ironically, brought it farther
away.  It seems nearer: after all, now, if you are curious about Zanzibar, Wikipedia is a few 
keystrokes away.  Before the Internet, you'd probably have been looking at a trip to the library and
a while wrestling with the card catalog; and that would be if you lived in an affluent, literate society. 
If you didn't, good luck knowing Zanzibar exists in the first place!

But if you were an illiterate random peasant farmer in some historical venue, and you needed to know
the growing season of taro or barley or insert-your-favorite-staple-crop-here, Wikipedia would have
been superfluous: you would already know it.  It would be unlikely that you would find a song lyrics
website of any use, because all of the songs you'd care about would be ones you really knew, in the
sense of having heard them sung by real people who could clarify the words on request, as opposed to
the "I think I heard half of this on the radio at the dentist's office last month" sense.
```

Per Kaj Sotala, the distributed cognition paradigm of research is all about exploring the idea behind "externalizing" or "outsourcing" our brains to the environment. An excerpt from [this primer](http://www.isr.uci.edu/~jpd/classes/ics234bs03/13-HollanEtAl-TOCHI.pdf):

```markdown
In several environments we found subjects using space to simplify choice by creating arrangements 
that served as heuristic cues. For instance, we saw them covering things, such as garbage disposal 
units or hot handles, thereby hiding certain affordances or signaling a warning and so constraining
what would be seen as feasible. At other times they would highlight affordances by putting items 
needing immediate attention near to them, or creating piles that had to be dealt with. We saw them lay
down items for assembly in a way that was unambiguously encoding the order in which they were to be 
put together or handed off. That is, they were using space to encode ordering information and so were 
off-loading memory. These are just a few of the techniques we saw them use to make their dedecision
problems combinatorially less complex.

We also found subjects reorganizing their workspace to facilitate perception: to make it possible to 
notice properties or categories that were not noticed before, to make it easier to find relevant items,
to make it easier for the visual system to track items. One subject explained how his father taught him 
to place the various pieces of his dismantled bicycle, many of which were small, on a sheet of newspaper.
This made the small pieces easier to locate and less likely to be kicked about. In videos of cooking we 
found chefs distinguishing otherwise identical spoons by placing them beside key ingredients or on the 
lids of their respective saucepans, thereby using their positions to differentiate or mark them. We found
jigsaw puzzlers grouping similar pieces together, thereby exploiting the capacity of the visual system to
note finer differences between pieces when surrounded by similar pieces than when surrounded by different
pieces.

Finally, we found a host of ways that embodied agents enlist the world to perform computation for them. 
Familiar examples of such off-loading show up in analog computations. When the tallest spaghetti noodle
is singled out from its neighbors by striking the bundle on a table, a sort computation is performed by 
using the material and spatial properties of the world. But more prosaically we have found in laboratory 
studies of the computer game Tetris that players physically manipulate forms to save themselves 
computational effort [Kirsh 2001; Kirsh and Maglio 1995]. They modify the environment to cue recall, to 
speed up identification, and to generate mental images faster than they could if unaided. In short, they 
make changes to the world to save themselves costly and potentially error-prone computations.
```

Sotala takes the distributed cognition idea-seed and runs away with it:

```markdown
Information processing doesn't only happen inside brains and computers. The paradigm of distributed 
cognition studies human societies as information-processing systems, with individuals being parts of
the larger system. For instance, the operation of an airliner cockpit's crew has been studied from 
this perpective [1]. For a flight to proceed without trouble, the different crew members need to be 
aware of information relating to their areas of responsibility at any given moment. If the crew is 
experienced and well trained, they'll constantly stay up to date by e.g. simply listening to other 
crew members converse with flight control. As flight control informs the captain of a new flight 
altitude, the rest of the pilots begin to adjust the altitude even while the captain is still
finishing up the communication. The cockpit functions as a unified system, and relevant information 
is propagated to wherever needed. Several crew members hearing the same information also allows for
error correction. If the message is unclear and the captain can't make out flight control's words, 
he can ask the others for clarification. The co-pilot answers the captain's query: even though one 
part of the system has failed to absorb the information received from outside the system, the same 
information has been stored in another part, which may then attempt to re-send it where needed.

Several other fields have been studied in the same manner, ranging from a child's language learning 
[2] to creativity [3]. A child doesn't learn language by itself and in a vacuum, but via interaction
with adults and older children. Creativity, on the other hand, requires common, shared "idea resources"
which individuals may use to come up with their own inventions and then give them back for others to 
refine further. Another theory of innovation considers inventions to be responses to problems encountered
by the community. Things such as bad laws or ineffective ways of doing things show up in community, and 
are considered problems by its members. This leads the community - the system - into a need state,
mobilizing its members to seek solutions until they're found.

One central idea is that social communities are cognitive architectures the same way that individual
minds are [4]. The argument is as follows. Cognitive processes involve trajectories of information 
(transmission and transformation), so the patterns of these information trajectories, if stable,
reflect some underlying cognitive architecture. Since social organization - plus the structure added
by the context of activity - largely determines the way information flows through a group, social 
organization may itself be viewed as a form of cognitive architecture.

In other words, says Sotala, "probably nothing to be worried about. Just normal human use of the environment."

Cosma Shalizi is a great read for collective cognition. Here's the introduction he wrote to the [Collective Cognition:
Mathematical Foundations of Distributed Intelligence](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~dynlearn/colcog/description.htm) workshop he co-organized awhile back, giving modern science and markets as examples:

```markdown
Many forms of individual cognition are enhanced by communication and collaboration with other 
intelligent agents. We propose to call this collective cognition, by analogy with the well known 
concept of collective action. People (and other intelligent agents) often "think better" in groups
and sometimes think in ways which would be simply impossible for isolated individuals. Perhaps the most
spectacular and important instance of collective cognition is modern science. An array of formal 
organizations and informal social institutions also can be considered means of collective cognition. For
instance, Hayek famously argued that competitive markets effectively calculate an adaptive allocation of
resources that could not be calculated by any individual market-participant. 

Hitherto the study of collective cognition has been qualitative, philosophical, even at times anecdotal.
Only recently, we believe, have the tools fallen into place to initiate a rigorous, quantitative science of
collective cognition. Moreover, it appears that soon there will be a real practical need for such a science.
```

A bit more on collective cognition:

```markdown
Collective cognition involves an interaction among three elements-the individual abilities of the agents,
their shared knowledge, and their communication structure. Cognitive collectives therefore resemble many
other complex systems which are collectives of goal-directed processes. Typically, the individual processes
know little of the detailed dynamics and the state of the overall system and, therefore, must use adaptive
techniques to achieve their goals. There are many naturally occurring examples, including human economies, 
human organizations, ecosystems, and even spin glasses. In addition, it has recently become clear that many
of the engineered systems of the future must be of this type, with massively distributed computational 
elements. There is optimism in the multi-agent system (MAS) field that widely applicable solutions to large,
distributed problems are close at hand. Some experts now believe that, in the information and
telecommunications networks of today, we have nascent examples of artificial cognitive collectives.
```

Collective cognition touches on a dazzling variety of fields: 

```markdown
Cognitive science
Situated agents
Emergent computation
Bounded rationality
Institutional economics
Economies of information
Evolutionary game theory
Cognitive ethology
Collective phenomena in physics
Neural computation and distributed representations
Distributed computation
Mechanism design
General equilibrium theory
Population biology
Robustness
Swarm intelligences
Reinforcement learning
Adaptive control
Cultural evolution
Cognitive sociology and the sociology of science
Telecommunications data routing
```

Some basic (i.e. foundational) questions of interest, at least for Cosma's workshop:

```markdown
Interaction between communication structure and cognitive performance.

How are knowledge dynamics and communication structure related? How are computational structure and 
communication structure related?

Why do some collectives not support much cognition and others support substandard or even pathological
forms?

When, and to what extent, can we attribute cognition, or at least computation, to the collective as 
such, rather than its individual members?

How much do we need to know about individual cognition to do adequate models of collective intelligence?

How can the capacity for collective cognition evolve?

Collective-action problems: Why should an agent contribute to the collective? Conversely, does the 
collective-cognition perspective shed any light on collective action in the conventional sense?

Incentive design: When we cannot directly control the goals individual agents, how can we still configure 
the system so that each agent has incentives to pursue a goal that is both readily achievable and good
for the overall collective?

How useful is fiat money in collectives whose agents are not human beings?

When and how should agents be induced to form teams?

When and how does agent heterogeneity enhance collective cognitive performance? Are "disagreement"
and "controversy" among agents always bad, or sometimes desirable for the collective?

How is robustness of behavior against external perturbation related to quality of behavior?
```

Cosma writes about collective cognition in a more fun-to-read way in his [review](http://bactra.org/reviews/cognition-in-the-wild/) of Edwin Hutchins' book *Cognition in the Wild*. It begins like so:

```markdown
Human beings coordinate their actions to do things which would be hard or impossible for them 
individually. This is not a particularly recondite fact, and the recognition of it is ancient; 
it is in the fifth book of Lucretius's De Rerum Natura, for instance. It was a commonplace of 
the Enlightenment, that most sociable age, and the philosophes were even, it seems, the first to 
realize that thinking, too, can be a collective activity, one conducted and amplified by social
groups --- which is not to say that societies have thoughts. ...

The nineteenth century, and to a lesser degree this one, have witnessed a dramatic expansion in 
the numbers of us engaged in administration, bureaucracy, management, oversight --- that is to say,
in formally-organized tasks of collective cognition and control. We did not invent bureaucracy, 
the mainstay of the ancient empires, but we're much, much better at it than they were. A random 
American town of 200,000 --- Piffleburg, WI, let us say --- will have police, a rescue squad, a fire
department, a hospital, universal schooling, several large factories, insurance offices, banks, a 
community college, a public library with several thousand volumes at least, a post office, public 
utilities, political parties, garbage collection, paved and usable roads everywhere, mercantile 
connections stretching across the country, and, with some luck, unions. These are corrupt, 
inefficient institutions which work poorly; every election, Piffleburg's citizens mutter something 
like "what do we pay taxes for anyway?" Yet to run any one of these institutions at the level of 
honesty, efficiency and efficacy which makes Piffleburg grumble would have demanded the full powers
and attention of even the ablest Roman propraetor or T'ang magistrate. That all of those institutions,
plus the ones not restricted to a single city, could be run at once, and while governed by a very 
ordinary slice of common humanity, would have seemed to such officials flatly impossible.
```

So why are we, as Cosma puts it, "so much better at collective endeavors than the ancients"? This is fairly easy to address:

```markdown
To a first approximation, the answer is: brute force and massive literacy. We teach nearly everyone to
read and write, and to do it, by historical standards, at a high level. This lets us staff large
bureaucracies (by some estimates, over 40% of the US workforce does data-handling), which lets us run an
industrial economy (the trains run on time), which makes us rich enough to afford to educate everyone 
and keep them in bureaucratic employment, with some surplus left over to expand the system. 

 This would do us no good if our ideas of administration were as shabby as those of our ancestors in the 
 dark ages, but they're not: we inherited those of the ancient empires, and have had quite a while to 
 improve upon them (and improvements are made easier and faster by the large number of administrators and
 the high standard of literacy). Among the improvements are many techniques (standardized procedures,
 standardized parts, standardized credentials and jobs, explicit qualifications for jobs and goods, files,
 standardized categories) and devices (forms, punch cards, punch card tabulators, adding machines, card
 catalogs, and, recently, computers) for making the administration of people and things easier.
```

Now while this is all splendid, it's "in the realm of technique"; when it comes to theory, nobody has any real idea how to explain what's going on:

```markdown
We don't really have a good theory about how collective action and cognition work, when and why they do, 
how they can be made to work better, why they fail, what they can and cannot accomplish, and so forth. 

Intellectually, these are large, tempting problems; technologically, they have obvious relevance to the 
design of parallel and distributed computers; economically, they could mean real money, not just billions;
and, in general, it'd be nice to know what it is we've gotten ourselves into.
```

Enter Edwin Hutchins, who conducted fieldwork studying navigation on a US navy ship based in San Diego with the problem of theoretically grounding collective cognition in mind. His fieldwork is interesting:

```markdown
Hutchins's field evidence consists of very detailed records, taken in the early 1980s, on the performance 
of the navigation crew of a helicopter carrier ship he calls the Palau, principally as they fix their 
location and plot their course near shore. The way it worked, in those pre-GPS days, was, roughly, this: 
three land-marks on shore, of known location on the navigation charts, would be selected by the main
person in charge, the "quartermaster of the watch." Then they'd "take bearings" on these, i.e. find the
orientation of the line from the landmark to the ship. These lines would be drawn on the chart. Now, it's 
an elementary result in Euclidean geometry that any two lines meet at a single point (unless they're parallel);
three lines form a triangle (unless they all meet at the same point). Somewhere within that triangle is the 
ship: this fixes the current position. The position of the ship at the next fix is estimated by "dead
reckoning," which is simply taking the current position and heading of the ship, and its planned speed, and 
extrapolating forward along the line of its heading. A single person can do this, if he's not too rushed.
Close to shore, the Navy gets worried, and demands fixes every few minutes, so the task gets broken down: 
naval flunkies take the bearings, a different flunky tells them when to take the bearings, and so on. There's 
a fairly rigid protocol for coordinating all these actions, and for communicating their results in a usable
form, and specialized instruments for making the job easier.

So, what does all this actually show? Well, that cognitive tasks can get spread over several people; that, 
in this instance, those who do tasks which require input from other people are generally superior to them in
rank; that the official job descriptions do not quite correspond to what people do; that people have a hard 
time believing things which are strange to them, and tend to ask those who report them questions along the 
lines of "Are you sure?"; that, if you don't know what something looks like, a verbal description can be very
unhelpful; that the right tools can make the job simpler; and that building computation into tools can make 
the job simpler for people, since it's easier to use a slide-rule than take a sine or a logarithm in your head;
that, if you can't talk about something, it's hard to make plans with someone else about it. There's more, but 
they're along the same lines.

These are not exactly earth-shaking results; in fact, they're about what common sense says to us. This doesn't 
make it useless to check them, since common sense is so often wrong; but even then, Hutchins has checked them
against the performance of one task (navigation; more particularly, location fixing), in one set of social 
groups (a couple of ships of the US Navy) --- ones where the social system is designed, and has received several
centuries of re-design from people whose common sense more or less agrees with the above. (One wonders if they
did things differently aboard the Potemkin.)
```

Unfortunately his conclusions are rubbish.

### Cognitive science
([overview](#overview))

From Cosma Shalizi's [review](http://bactra.org/reviews/cognition-in-the-wild/) of Edwin Hutchins' book *Cognition in the Wild*:

```markdown
Cognition, whether human, animal or artificial, is a kind of information-processing, taking place, in our
case, in the brain. The information takes the form of representations (of sensory stimuli, of states of 
parts of the world, of facts, of relations, of possible states of parts of the world, of courses of action,
or what-not). The processing consists of the transformation of these representations according to definite,
though perhaps stochastic, rules. (So far, we have not excluded the connectionist heretics.) An immense amount
of information-processing takes place subconsciously, particularly that which turns raw irritation of the 
afferent nerves into useful perceptions of the world about us, and turns volitions into raw stimulations of
the efferent nerves. To recognize a dagger you see before you involves a lot of computational work; some people,
having been wounded in the parts of the brain which do the computations, cannot. At least at some level of 
abstraction, the representations and transformations are usefully, conveniently and/or accurately thought of as
structures of symbols and as algorithms, respectively. (This does rule out the connectionists.) The algorithms 
may be (or, if you like, instantiate) rules of inference, or rules for producing new representations from old 
ones more generally ("production systems"). 

One particularly well-studied kind of cognition, sometimes taken as the paradigm of all cognition, is
problem-solving, conceived of as turning a representation of the problem, step by step, into a representation of
a solution, or something close enough to a solution to satisfy the problem-solver. (Expertise in solving a kind 
of problem consists in knowing good algorithms to apply to it, being able to represent a problem in a way which
makes it easy to solve, and being able to recognize a solution when you have one.) In principle, all this takes 
place in the brain; in practice, we can fake a larger and more accurate memory than we possess by either using 
external symbols, or by taking advantage of regular and persistent parts of our environment.

### Names matter
([overview](#overview))

In Michael Nielsen's essay [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) there's a section recounting a famous story in physics I've always taken to heart, the one by Dick Feynman dismissing the value of knowing the names of things:

```markdown
One kid (a know-it-all) says to me, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that?” 

I said, “I haven't the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” 

He says, “It'a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn't teach you anything!” 

But it was the opposite. He (Feynman's father) had already taught me: “See that bird?” 
he says. “It's a Spencer's warbler.” (I knew he didn't know the real name.) “Well, in 
Italian, it's a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it's a Bom da Peida… You can know the name 
of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely
nothing whatever about the bird! You'll only know about humans in different places, and what they
call the bird. So let's look at the bird and see what it's *doing* — that's what counts.” (I
learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)
```

Roger Zelazny puts it far more poetically in his novel *Lords of Light* in one of the most powerful passages I've ever read:

```markdown
Sam sat with his eyes closed for several minutes, then said softly:

"I have many names, and none of them matter." He opened his eyes slightly then, but he did not 
move his head. He looked upon nothing in particular.

"Names are not important," he said. "To speak is to name names, but to speak is not important.

"A thing happens once that has never happened before. Seeing it, a man looks on reality. He cannot
tell others what he has seen. Others wish to know, however, so they question him saying, 'What is 
it like, this thing you have seen?'

"So he tries to tell them. Perhaps he has seen the very first fire in the world. He tells them, 
'It is red, like a poppy, but through it dance other colors. It has no form, like water, flowing 
everywhere. It is warm, like the sun of summer, only warmer. It exists for a time on a piece of wood,
and then the wood is gone, as though it were eaten, leaving behind that which is black and can be 
sifted like sand. When the wood is gone, it too is gone.'

"Therefore, the hearers must think reality is like a poppy, like water, like the sun, like that which
eats and excretes. They think it is like to anything that they are told it is like by the man who has 
known it. But they have not looked upon fire. They cannot really *know* it. They can only know *of* it.

"But fire comes again into the world, many times. More men look upon fire. After a time, fire is 
as common as grass and clouds and the air they breathe. They see that, while it is like a poppy, 
it is not a poppy, while it is like water, it is not water, while it is like the sun, it is not 
the sun, and while it is like that which eats and passes wastes, it is not that which eats and
passes wastes, but something different from each of these apart or all of these together. So they
look upon this new thing and they make a new word to call it. They call it 'fire.'

"If they come upon one who still has not seen it and they speak to him of fire, he does not know 
what they mean. So they, in turn, fall back upon telling him what fire is like. As they do, they 
know from their own experience that what they are telling him is not the truth, but only a part of it.
They know that this man will never know reality from their words, though all the words in the world 
are theirs to use. He must look upon the fire, smell of it, warm his hands by it, stare into its heart,
or remain forever ignorant.

"Therefore, 'fire' does not matter, 'earth' and 'air' and 'water' do not matter. 'I' do not matter.
No word matters.

"But man forgets reality and remembers words. The more words he remembers, the cleverer do his fellows
esteem him. He looks upon the great transformations of the world, but he does not see them as they were
seen when man looked upon reality for the first time. Their names come to his lips and he smiles as he 
tastes them, thinking he knows them in the naming. The thing that has never happened before is still 
happening. It is still a miracle. The great burning blossom squats, flowing, upon the limb of the world,
excreting the ash of the world, and being none of these things I have named and at the same time 
all of them, and *this* is reality—the Nameless.”
```

Nielsen pushes back against this attitude insofar as it goes too far:

```markdown
It's a good story. But it goes too far: names do matter. Maybe not as much as the know-it-all kid
thought, and they're not usually a deep kind of knowledge. But they're the foundation that allows 
you to build up a network of knowledge.

This trope that names don't matter was repeatedly drilled into me during my scientific training.
When I began using Anki, at first I felt somewhat silly putting questions about names for things 
into the system. But now I do it enthusiastically, knowing that it's an early step along the way 
to understanding.

Anki is useful for names of all kinds of things, but I find it particularly helpful for non-verbal
things. For instance, I put in questions about artworks, like: “What does the artist Emily Hare's 
painting Howl look like?”.

I put that question in for two reasons. The main reason is that I like to remember the experience of
the painting from time to time. And the other is to put a name to the painting.( Actually, a better
question for that is to be shown the painting and asked what its name is.) If I wanted to think more 
analytically about the painting – say, about the clever use of color gradients – I could add more
detailed questions. But I'm pretty happy just committing the experience of the image to memory.

Friends sometimes complain that many books are over-padded essays. Perhaps a benefit of such padding
is that it enforces an Anki-like spaced repetition, since readers take weeks to read the book. This
may be an inefficient way to memorize the main points, but is better than having no memory of the 
book at all.

Qiaochu Yuan comments on Luke Muehlhauser's post [Writing style and the typical mind fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7Q3MoE9YzFMxGZR7F/writing-style-and-the-typical-mind-fallacy):

```markdown
Rather than "abstract stuff first, examples later" or "examples first, abstract stuff later"
I prefer a hybrid approach: give as much of the abstract stuff as is necessary to motivate why
you're looking at the examples (which may be no abstract stuff at all), then give the examples,
then give the rest of the abstract stuff. The main application I have in mind is mathematical 
writing, where sometimes a definition is very hard to motivate without examples, but sometimes
the examples are very hard to motivate without looking at a previously well-understood abstraction
first. The problem I have with always giving examples first is that I often don't know what to do
with the examples if they haven't been properly introduced: where, in the filesystem of my brain,
should I be filing these things?
```

Qiaochu is a wonderful math expositor, one of the best in the business. See also [why most math writing sucks](#why-math-is-boring).

From Stephen King:

```markdown
I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs and I will shout it from the rooftops. 
To put it another way, they're like dandelions. If you have one on your lawn it's pretty
and unique. If you fail to root it out, however, you find five the next day . . . fifty 
the day after that . . . and then, my brothers and sisters, your lawn is totally,
completely, and profligately covered with dandelions. By then you see them for the weeds 
they are, but by then it's--GASP!!--too late.

If you want to be a writer, then you must do two things above all others: read a lot and 
write a lot.

You must be prepared to do some serious turning inward toward the life of the imagination,
and that means, I'm afraid, that Geraldo, Keith Obermann, and Jay Leno must go. Reading 
takes time, and the glass teat takes too much of it.

Must you write complete sentences each time, every time? Perish the thought.

It's always easier to kill someone else's darlings than it is to kill your own.

United States of America are gathered.
They are goats.

As the 155-millimeter howitzer shells whistled down on this crumbling city today, exploding

Here's a comment by Scott Alexander on Luke Muehlhauser's LW post [Rhetoric for the good](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SiGY7aah56HvGXxBJ/rhetoric-for-the-good) which I lost years ago, and am delighted to stumble upon again:

```markdown
There's that quote about how "the most important thing is sincerity, and if you can fake that, 
you've got it made." So there are two equal and opposite commandments for popular writing. First,
you've got to sound like you're chatting with your reader, like you're giving them an unfiltered 
stream-of-consciousness access to your ideas as you think them. Second, *on no account should you
actually do that*.

Eliezer is one of the masters at this; his essays are littered with phrases like "y'know" and 
"pretty much", but they're way too tight to be hastily published first drafts (or maybe I'm wrong 
and Eliezer is one of the few people in the world who can do this; chances are you're not). You've 
got to put *a lot of work* into making something look that spontaneous. I'm a fan of words like "sorta"
and "kinda" myself, but I have literally gone through paragraphs and replaced all of the "to some 
degrees" with "sortas" to get the tone how I wanted it.

I like inserting myself and my thought processes into things I write. It's a no-no in serious writing,
but in informal writing it can emphasize the informality and become endearing, a sort of "we can take 
off the masks now, because we're all friends here". This only works if your personal asides are actually
endearing to people, or at least not actively boring and off-putting, but if you get it right it lets 
you keep more spontaneity, since talking in first person is a natural impulse. As in everything, "first
learn the rules and the reasons for them, then break them as much as you want".

The real meat of writing comes from an intuitive flow of words and ideas that surprises even yourself. 
Editing can only enhance and purify writing so far; it needs to have some natural potential to begin with.
My own process here is to mentally rehearse an idea very many times without even thinking about writing.
Once I'm an expert at explaining it to myself or an imaginary partner, then I transcribe the explanation
I settle upon (some people say they don't think in words; I predict writing will not come naturally to
these people). *Then* I edit the heck out of it.

The best way to improve the natural flow of ideas, and your writing in general, is to read *really good 
writers* so much that you unconsciously pick up their turns of phrase and don't even realize when you're
using them. The best time to do that is when you're eight years old; the second best time is now.

Your role models here should be those vampires who hunt down the talented, suck out their souls, and absorb
their powers. Which writers' souls you feast upon depends on your own natural style and your goals. I've
gained most from reading Eliezer, Mencius Moldbug, Aleister Crowley, and G.K. Chesterton; I'm currently making
my way through Chesterton's collected works pretty much with the sole aim of imprinting his writing style into 
my brain.

Stepping from the sublime to the ridiculous, I took a lot from reading Dave Barry when I was a child. He 
has a very observational sense of humor, the sort where instead of going out looking for jokes, he just
writes about a topic and it ends up funny. It's not hard to copy if you're familiar enough with it. And
if you can be funny, people will read you whether you have any other redeeming qualities or not.

Getting imprinted with good writers like this will serve you for your entire life. It will serve you 
whether you're on your fiftieth draft of a thesis paper, or you're rushing a Less Wrong comment in
the three minutes before you have to go to work. It will even serve you in regular old non-written
conversation, because wit and clarity are independent of medium.

And it will also inform and limit your use of all the other rules above. Luke's fourth point - 
telling stories about characters taking actions - is a good one, but he very reasonably didn't start
this post off with a story about some student working on a term paper. There have been a few LW posts
that kind of seemed kludgy and artificial in adding characters and stories, and others that did it 
really well. Probably some very smart person could figure out why it succeeds somewhere and fails 
somewhere else, but it's easier to just cultivate the virtue that is nameless.

Some people say to write down everything and only edit later. I take the opposite tack. I used to 
believe that I rarely edited at all because I usually publish something as soon as it's done. Then
a friend watching me write said that she was getting seasick from my tendency to go back and forth 
deleting and rewriting the same sentence fragment or paragraph before moving on. Most likely the 
best writers combine both editing methods.
```

Scott's original comments came with links to examples of what he considered particularly good writing: [Eliezer](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/), [Mencius Moldbug](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html), [Aleister Crowley](http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm), [G.K. Chesterton](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics.iv_1.html), [Dave Barry](http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/01/1992746/dave-barrys-2010-year-in-review.html). 

Scott's [Nonfiction writing advice](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) is specialized for argumentative topics, which isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it has gems. 

The one I keep returning to the most is the idea of *microhumor*:

```markdown
You’ve heard of microaggressions. Now try microhumor. It’s things that aren’t a *joke* in the 
laugh-out-loud told-by-a-comedian sense, but still put the tiniest ghost of a smile on your reader’s
face while they’re skimming through them.

I learned this art from Dave Barry and Scott Adams, both of whom are humor writers and use normal 
macrohumor, but both of whom pepper the spaces in between jokes with microhumor besides. Your best 
best is to read everything they’ve written, your second best bet is to listen to me fumblingly try 
to explain it.

Here’s a paragraph from my “about” page:

*Topics here tend to center vaguely around this meta-philosophical idea of how people evaluate 
arguments for their beliefs, and especially whether this process is spectacularly broken in a way
that may or may not doom us all.*

There are a couple of things here that might qualify as microhumor. Take “especially whether this
process is spectacularly broken in a way that may or may not doom us all”. It’s not really a *joke*.
If I were a comedian and recited that sentence, you wouldn’t start laughing. But it’s kind of funny
to be starting with what sounds like a pretty dry academic idea (“how people evaluate arguments for
their beliefs” and whether the process is broken), and then confound expectations with an exaggerated
(well, maybe) warning about it dooming us all. The phrase “may or may not doom us all” does the same
thing on a smaller scale: “may or may not” is a pretty reserved, careful sounding phrase, whereas
“doom us all” is obviously the opposite of reserved (I also like the similar construction “it might
have sort of kind of been the worst idea ever”).

You can actually go a long way toward microhumor just with hedge words (“vaguely”, “sort of”), 
exaggerations (“the worst thing ever”, “doom us all”), and sometimes the combination of the two.

I think this microhumor stuff is really important, maybe the number one thing that separates really 
enjoyable writers from people who are technically proficient but still a chore to read. Think about
it with a really simplistic behaviorist model where you keep doing things that give you little bursts
of reward, and stop doing things that don’t. There are only a couple of sources of reward in reading.
One of them is getting important insights. Another is hearing things that support your ingroups or
bash your outgroups. And a third – maybe the biggest – is humor. Who ever had trouble slogging through
a really hilarious book of jokes?

Nobody can be super funny all the time, and an article on the economic crisis filled with man-walks-
into-a-bar-style jokes would be jarring and weird. But micro-humor really works. It works at a background 
level where people don’t notice it working, and it makes people keep coming back for more.

Humor is also disarming. It’s hard to hate somebody who’s making you laugh. I don’t mean somebody who’s 
making bigoted jokes that offend you, or writing political cartoons about how awful your ingroup is.
Those people are easy to hate. I mean somebody who’s making you laugh, right now. If you can make people
laugh while challenging their cherished beliefs, you’ve got a tiny bit more good will than usual.
```

It turns out that many of my favorite writers are masters of microhumor. Steve Yegge is another one -- see [here](#practical-magic). 

<a name="#the-art-of-plain-talk"></a>
### The art of plain talk
([overview](#overview))

Rudolf Flesch's book [The Art of Plain Talk](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HNDRLO/ref=nosim?tag=lukeprogcom-20) has a lot of great quotes. First, an observation: 

```markdown
Grammar is what makes sentences difficult. Conjugations, declensions, irregular verbs, ablatives,
subjunctives, and aorists, oh my!
```

Then a claim, persuasively made:

```markdown
It might help if we wrote in Chinese, the “grammarless” tongue. Chinese has no inflections. No cases.
No persons. No genders. No degrees. No tenses. No voices. No moods. No infinitives. No participles.
No gerunds. No irregular verbs. No articles. No prefixes or suffixes.

This is not because Chinese is primitive. Chinese was once an irregular, complicated mess like 
English. But the Chinese people, generation after generation, changed it into a streamlined machine
for expressing ideas.

We say “A man bites a dog.” They say “Man bite dog.” We say “A dog is an animal.” They say “Dog: animal.” 
We say “The sun is bright and shiny.” They say “Sun shine.”

This may sound like baby talk. But look closely and you will see that Chinese offers the same meaning 
without the baggage.

Now look at English. We have the word 'sign', meaning “a mark.” Add a suffix and you get 'signify', “to make
a mark.” Add another suffix and you have 'significant', “making a mark.” Add a prefix and you have 
'insignificant', “making no mark.” Add another suffix for 'insignificance', “the making of no mark.” We took
a simple noun and made it into a verb, an adjective, another adjective, and again a noun.

After all those complications, we can be philosophical and talk about the *insignificance of man*. The
Chinese would just talk about *man no mark*.

Good writers work hard to make the abstract concrete. The Chinese have no abstract words to begin with. 
English philosophers may write that “The health of societies is not benefited by a mass of individuals
desiring radical differentiation from each other, nor by a mass of individuals lacking independent thought
and action.” Chinese philosophers say “Do not be rare like jade or common like stone.”
```

At this point I'm of two minds. I like where Flesch is getting at, but don't like the complete lack of abstract words to work with. Abstraction is a double-edged sword, not an unalloyed evil.

But let's go with Flesch -- how might we write more plainly?

```markdown
Once, I was reading a philosophy essay of mine to my girlfriend. She could barely understand it. 
“Why don’t you just say it like you said it to me yesterday?” she asked.

As hard as it is to write in plain talk, we speak in plain talk all the time. What is it about our
talking that is clearer than our writing?

When speaking, we may use big words and a fast pace and complex grammar, but we give the other person 
time to understand us. We repeat ourselves. We use filler words. We pause.

But when writing, we eliminate all repeated and irrelevant words. If every word is important, the 
reader may not have time to digest what is being said because your ideas are coming at him too quickly.

We write like this: “Perhaps the toughest intellectual work we must do regarding European reconstruction
is to realize that it can be achieved through nonpolitical instrumentalities. Reconstruction will not be
politics, but engineering.”

We talk like this: “We have a tough job ahead of us, I think. Reconstructing Europe is a tough job, and 
it’s a job of thinking; of figuring out how to do it. We can’t do it with politics, I don’t think. No, 
it won’t be done with politics. It’ll be more like building a bridge; more like engineering. That’s the
way I see it, anyway.”

The first version is concise. It moves rapidly and requires strict concentration. But readers are 
surrounded by distractions. They need the repetition, pauses, and filler of the second version to keep 
up with your thought, or else they may have to read your sentences twice. Put space between your ideas.

We might combine the clarity of the first version with the readability of the second version like this:
“We have a tough job ahead of us. We need to figure out how to reconstruct Europe. It won’t happen with
political forces. The European reconstruction will be a matter of engineering, not politics.”
```

Flesch on avoiding brevity for brevity's sake:

```markdown
Simplicity and brevity are not the same thing. Plain talk can be slow. Condensed sentences are often tough
to read.

Brevity-worship can lead you to use confusing abbreviations, such as the famous Variety headline: STIX NIX
HIX PIX. To loyal Variety readers, this meant that small-town moviegoers disliked rural pictures. To the 
rest of us, it meant nothing.

Condensed writing is for experts. Plain talk is for everyone else. Consider this sentence: “We need long-
range planning for industrialization with long-term credit financing, decent wage guarantees, protection of
national interests and equal participation of domestic and foreign capital.”

We need lots of simple words to translate all those big words into plain English. Here, simplifying means 
*lengthening*, not shortening. Brevity is great, but simplicity is greater.
```

Engaging human interest:

```markdown
We know nothing better than ourselves. We speak and think best about us. That’s why it is a bit easier to
read and understand “Stalin drinks vodka” than “Vodka contains alcohol.” Give your writing human interest.

Newspapers add human interest to a scene by giving an eyewitness report. Scientific findings are reported 
as an unraveling mystery; the scientists as detectives. Public policy reporting is given from the 
biographical view of the persons pushing for policy change.

How might we engage human interest in this bland paragraph? “Du Pont this week announced a new product as
potentially profitable as its nylon. It is wood impregnated with chemicals that transform it into a hard,
polished material. Wood so treated does not warp, split, or shrink.”

It is easy to give your writing human interest. Look at each sentence and find the logical—not the 
grammatical—subject. The logical subject of almost everything that humans care about is human.

Who announced a new product? A corporation? No, people announced a new product: “The Du Pont people this
week announced…”

Next: Who impregnated the wood? The Du Pont people! So: “They have impregnated wood…”

But isn’t the subject of the next sentence wood? To find the logical subject in this sentence, ask: How do 
you know? Well, how does anyone know a scientific fact? By testing. So: “Their tests show that wood so 
treated does not warp…”

Our revised paragraph is less concise. But that gives our readers time to keep up with our thought. And 
now, the paragraph is about our readers’ favorite subject, people: “The Du Pont people this week announced
a new product as potentially profitable as its nylon. They have impregnated wood with chemicals that
transform it into a hard, polished material. Their tests show that wood so treated does not warp, split, 
or shrink.”

I actually don't know where exactly [this quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/373814-this-sentence-has-five-words-here-are-five-more-words) by Gary Provost comes from, but it's a classic:

```markdown
This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. 
But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. 
The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. 

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a
pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. 
And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable
length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of 
the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
```

Note that this quote applies equally well to [nonfiction writing](#nonfiction).

<a name="#show-dont-tell"></a>
### Show, don't tell
([overview](#overview))

Veltzeh's [More on Writing: Show vs. Tell](http://veltzeh.livejournal.com/17035.html) argues against "show, don't tell":

```markdown
There is another thing about "showing" that bugs me, and it's that very often, when I read guides 
and such about how to "show" rather than "tell", the only thing I see in those guides is that 
"showing" conveys different information than "telling". They create different scenes. And of course
I have more problems with the scenes that "show".

When the scene is "shown", I have a hard time staying with the text and understanding what's going on.
If I'm not told what a particular thing means, it starts just seeming nonsensical to me. The author 
(and many readers) might understand the tone of voice of a character whose line is written in a certain
way, but I'm likely to miss it. And so I'll end up clueless as to the character's state of mind. Now,
if I was TOLD exactly what the character's state of mind is, no problem. I might be bad at imagining
certain emotions, but it's definitely easier to read exactly what it's supposed to be than to try to
find and guess what parts show it.

Maybe it's just me, though. That doesn't make me less frustrated with writing that routinely frustrates
me with what I often perceive as non sequiturs. Therefore, I hope that more writings BOTH "showed" AND 
"told"! At least I'm trying to aim for both showing and telling in my writings from now on.
```

This is interesting to me, because it runs counter to the standard advice.

### Yegge's conservative-liberal axis
([overview](#overview))

Steve Yegge's post/rant/essay [Notes from the Mystery Machine Bus](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz) begins, after a meandering half-drunken introduction, with the following theses:

```markdown
I've spent the past eight years (starting back in June 2004) writing elaborate rants about a bunch
of vaguely related software engineering issues. I was doing all that ranting because I've been 
genuinely perplexed by a set of "bizarre" world-views held dear by -- as far as I can tell -- about
half of all programmers I encounter, whether online or in person.

Last week, after nearly a decade of hurling myself against this problem, I've finally figured it out.
I know exactly what's been bothering me. Here is the thesis of this looooong essay. It is the root
cause that motivated over half of my ranting all these years, starting at Amazon and continuing here 
at Google.

1) Software engineering has its own political axis, ranging from conservative to liberal.

2) The notions of "conservative" and "liberal" on this political axis are specialized to software 
engineering. But they exhibit some strong similarities to their counterparts in real-world politics.

3) Everyone in the software industry who does stuff related to programming computers falls somewhere
fairly precise on this political spectrum, whether they realize it or not.

Just as in real-world politics, software conservatism and liberalism are radically different world
views. Make no mistake: they are at odds. They have opposing value systems, priorities, core beliefs 
and motivations. These value systems clash at design time, at implementation time, at diagnostic time,
at recovery time. They get along like green eggs and ham.
```

What's so important about recognizing this distinction?

```markdown
It probably won't help us agree on anything, pretty much by definition. Any particular issue only 
makes it onto the political axis if there is a fundamental, irreconcilable difference of opinion about
it. Programmers probably won't -- or maybe even can't -- change their core value systems.

But the political-axis framework gives us a familiar set of ideas and terms for identifying areas of 
fundamental disagreement. This can lead to faster problem resolution. Being able to identify something
quickly as a well-defined political issue means we can stop wasting time trying to convince the other
side to change their minds, and instead move directly into the resolution phase, which (just as in 
politics) generally boils down to negotiation and compromise. Or, you know, Watergate.

Or at the very least, the conservative/liberal classification should help the two camps steer clear of
each other. I think it is probably better to have a harmonious team of all-liberals or all-conservatives
than a mixed team of constantly clashing ideologies. It's a lot like how vehicle-driving philosophies 
can differ regionally -- it's OK if everyone drives in some crazy way, as long as they ALL drive that way.
```

I'm honestly not that interested in the minutiae of Real Politics (TM) (even though "politics is interested in You! Yes, YOU!!"), so I'll go straight to the quotes that caught my fancy. 

What's a "software liberal/conservative"?

```markdown
It's easiest to talk first about conservatives, and then define liberals in terms of what conservatives 
are not. This is because conservatives tend to have a unified and easily-articulated value system, whereas 
liberals tend to be more weakly organized and band together mostly as a reaction to conservatism. ...

Conservatism, at its heart, is really about risk management. ...

Liberalism doesn't lend itself quite as conveniently to a primary root motivation. But for our purposes
we can think of it as a belief system that is motivated by the desire above all else to effect change. 
In corporate terms, as we observed, it's about changing the world. In software terms, liberalism aims 
to maximize the speed of feature development, while simultaneously maximizing the flexibility of the 
systems being built, so that feature development never needs to slow down or be compromised.

To be sure, conservatives think that's what they're maximizing too. But their approach is... well, 
conservative. Flexibility and productivity are still motivators, but they are not the primary motivators.
Safety always trumps other considerations, and performance also tends to rank very highly in the software-
conservative's value system.

The crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives in the software world is this: how much
focus should you put on safety? Not just compile-time type-safety, but also broader kinds of "idiot-
proofing" for systems spanning more than one machine.
```

How they view each other is the same as in real-world politics:

```markdown
Software liberals are viewed by conservatives as slovenly, undisciplined, naive, unprincipled, downright
"bad" engineers. And liberals view conservatives as paranoid, fearmongering, self-defeating bureaucrats.
```

Conservatives would rate these example statements much higher-importance than liberals:

```markdown
1. Software should aim to be bug free before it launches. (Banner claim: "Debugging Sucks!") Make sure
your types and interfaces are all modeled, your tests are all written, and your system is fully
specified before you launch. Or else be prepared for the worst!

2. Programmers should be protected from errors. Many language features are inherently error-prone and 
dangerous, and should be disallowed for all the code we write. We can get by without these features, 
and our code will be that much safer.

3. Programmers have difficulty learning new syntax. We should limit the number of languages used at our
company, so that nobody has to learn a new syntax when a system goes down in the middle of the night 
on Christmas Eve. And we should never permit features that allow defining new syntax, nor changing the
semantics of existing syntax. (Common examples: no operator overloading, and NO metaprogramming!)

4. Production code must be safety-checked by a compiler. Any code that cannot be statically checked 
should in general be avoided. In specific cases where it is strictly necessary, uses of it must be 
approved by a central committee. (Examples: eval, dynamic invocation, RTTI).

5. Data stores must adhere to a well-defined, published schema. Relational databases must be in third-
normal form and adhere to a UML or equivalent schema definition. XML should have a DTD. NoSQL databases
and name/value stores -- both of which should be avoided in general -- must have a separate physical 
schema that defines all permissible keys and their corresponding value types.
 
6. Public interfaces should be rigorously modeled. Data should never be stored in strings or untyped 
collections. All input and output entities should be thorougly and explicitly specified via statically-
checkable, ideally object-oriented models.

7. Production systems should never have dangerous or risky back-doors. It should never be possible to
connect to a live production system via a debugger, telnet shell, nor any other interface that allows
the developer to manipulate the runtime operation of the code or data. The only ports into a production
system should be read-only monitoring channels.

8. If there is ANY doubt as to the safety of a component, it cannot be allowed in production -- no 
matter how teams may cry and wail that they need it to make forward progress. (I'm talkin' to you, FUSE).

9. Fast is better than slow. Everyone hates slow code. Code should perform well. You should engineer 
all your code for optimum speed up front, right out of the box. Otherwise it might not be fast enough. 
Avoid using languages or DSLs or libraries that have a reputation for being slow.  Even if they're 
fast enough for your current purposes, the requirements (or callers) could change, and suddenly the
software would be too slow!
```

Liberals would instead agree more with the following example statements:

```markdown
1. Bugs are not a big deal. They happen anyway, no matter how hard you try to prevent them, and somehow
life goes on. Good debuggers are awesome pieces of technology, and stepping through your code gives you 
insights you can't get any other way. Debugging and diagnosing are difficult arts, and every programmer
should be competent with them. The Christmas Eve Outage scenario never, ever happens in practice --
that's what code freeze is for. Bugs are not a big deal! (This belief really may be the key dividing
philosophy between Conservative and Liberal philosophies.)

2. Programmers are only newbies for a little while. The steady state for a programmer's career is being
smart, knowledgeable, creative, resourceful and experienced. Putting a bunch of rules in place to
protect newbies from doing harm (or being harmed) is incorrectly optimizing for the transient case
instead of the steady state.

3. Programmers figure stuff out amazingly fast when their jobs depend on it. People learn to read sheet
music, braille, sign language, and all sorts of other semiotic frameworks. Hell, even gorillas can 
apparently do all that. Programmers don't need protection from syntax. They just need documentation and 
a little slack time to read up on it.

4. Succinctness is power. Code should be kept small. Period. If your static checking tools can't reason 
about the code, then the checking needs to be made smarter (e.g. by incorporating runtime data) rather
than making the code dumber.

5. Rigid schemas limit flexibility and slow down development. Lightweight/partial/optional schemas are a 
better tradeoff. Moreover, the schema is often not well-understood until a lot of data is collected and a
lot of use cases are thorougly exercised. So the schema should follow the code rather than precede it.

6. Public interfaces should above all else be simple, backward-compatible, and future-compatible. Rigorous
modeling is just guessing at how the interface will need to evolve. It makes both forward- and backward-
compatibility almost impossible, resulting in interface churn and customer unhappiness. Public interfaces 
should always do the simplest thing that could possibly work, and grow only as needed.

7. System flexibility can mean the difference between you getting the customer (or contract) vs. your 
competitor nabbing it instead. Security and safety risks in runtime production systems can be mitigated 
and controlled by logging, monitoring and auditing. There are plenty of existence-proofs of large systems 
with root-access backdoors and shells (e.g. RDBMS, online game servers) whose risk is controlled while 
still giving them world-class runtime flexibility.

8. Companies should take risks, embrace progress, and fiercely resist ossification. It doesn't matter how
big your business is: it must grow or die. If you want to stay competitive, you have to make a conscious,
often painful effort to take risks. Which means you'll need good recovery techniques for the inevitable
disasters. But you need those even if you don't take risks.  So take risks!

9. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Get the code working first, focusing on correctness
over performance, and on iterative prototyping over correctness. Only when your customers list latency 
as the top priority should you begin performing profiler-driven optimizations.
```

Here Steve tosses "a bunch of random technologies, patterns, designs and disciplines each into one of six buckets: "apolitical", "conservative", "centrist", "liberal" buckets, plus two buckets that start Centrist and head Left or Right in the presence of overuse":

```markdown
*Non-political Stuff*: Algorithms, data structures, concrete mathematics, complexity analysis, 
information theory, type theory, computation theory, and so on. Basically all CS theory. These 
disciplines occasionally inspire tempest-in-a-teapot butthurtedness in academia, but when it
happens, it's just similar fish in too small a tank biting on each other. It's to be expected.
Overall, these essentially mathematical disciplines are timeless, and they are all equally 
applicable to both the Liberal and Conservative programming worlds.  Yes, even type theory.

*Conservative Stuff*: Provably sound type systems. Mandatory static type annotations. Nonpublic
symbol visibility modifiers (private/protected/friend/etc.). Strict, comprehensive schemas. all-
warnings-are-errors. Generics and templates. Avoidance of DSLs (XPath, regexps) in favor of 
explicit DOM manipulation and hand-rolled state machines.  Build dependency restrictions.  Forced
API deprecation and retirement.  No type equivalence (i.e. no automatic conversions) for numeric
types.  Checked exceptions.  Single-pass compilers.  Software Transactional Memory.  Type-based
function overloading.  Explicit configuration in preference to convention. Pure-functional data
structures.  Any kind of programming with the word "Calculus" in it.

*Centrist (or flat-out Neutral) Stuff*: Unit testing. Documentation. Lambdas. Threads. Actors.
Callbacks.  Exceptions.  Continuations and CPS.  Byte-compilation.  Just-in-time compilation. 
Expression-only languages (no statements).  Multimethods. Declarative data structures.  Literal
syntax for data structures.  Type dispatch.

*Liberal Stuff*: Eval. Metaprogramming. Dynamic scoping. all-errors-are-warnings. Reflection and 
dynamic invocation. RTTI. The C preprocessor. Lisp macros. Domain-specific languages (for the most
part). Optional parameters. Extensible syntax. Downcasting.  Auto-casting.  reinterpret_cast.  
Automatic stringification.  Automatic type conversions across dissimilar types.  Nil/null as an
overloaded semantic value (empty list, empty string, value-not-present).  Debuggers.  Bit fields.
Implicit conversion operators (e.g. Scala's implicits).  Sixty-pass compilers.  Whole-namespace 
imports.  Thread-local variables.  Value dispatch.  Arity-based function overloading.  Mixed-
type collections.  API compatibility modes.  Advice and AOP.  Convention in preference to
explicit configuration.

*Centrist Stuff that Becomes Conservative If Taken Far Enough*: Type modeling. Relational modeling. 
Object modeling. Interface modeling. Functional (i.e., side-effect-free) programming.

*Centrist Stuff that Becomes Liberal if Taken Far Enough*: Dynamic class loading and dynamic code 
loading. Virtual method dispatch. Buffer-oriented programming.
```

Natural themes arise:

```markdown
 -- implicit is generally liberal; explicit is generally conservative.

 -- performance-oriented is generally conservative; late-optimized is generally liberal.

 -- compile-time binding is generally conservative; runtime/late binding is generally liberal.

 -- concurrency and parallelism in general seem to be politically charged topics, but the 
 disagreement is orthogonal to the liberal/conservative camps.
```

Programming languages:

```markdown
Here are some very rough categorizations. Note that within each language camp there are typically 
liberal and conservative sub-camps. But as a whole, language usage tends to be dominated by what 
the language makes possible (and easy), so the culture tends to follow the features.

This list is just a few representative examples to give you the flavor. I'm only listing general-
purpose languages here, since DSLs and query languages are typically feature-restricted enough to
be hard to categorize.

Assembly language: Batshit liberal.

Perl, Ruby, PHP, shell-script: Extremist liberal.

JavaScript, Visual Basic, Lua: Hardcore liberal.

Python, Common Lisp, Smalltalk/Squeak: Liberal.

C, Objective-C, Scheme: Moderate-liberal.

C++, Java, C#, D, Go: Moderate-conservative.

Clojure, Erlang, Pascal: Conservative.

Scala, Ada, OCaml, Eiffel: Hardcore conservative.

Haskell, SML: Extremist conservative.

One thing that jumps out is that a language doesn't have to be statically-typed or even strongly-
typed in order to be conservative overall. More on that in a bit.

The next thing you might notice from the list is that the liberal and moderate languages are all 
pretty popular, and that popularity declines sharply as languages head into conservative territory.

I think this has a simple explanation: It's possible to write in a liberal language with a conservative 
accent, but it's very hard (and worse, discouraged) to write in a conservative language with a liberal
accent.

For instance, it's straightforward to write JavaScript code in a way that eschews reflection, eval, 
most automatic type casting, prototype inheritance, and other dynamic features. You can write
JavaScript that plods along as unadventurously as, say, Pascal. It doesn't have all the static 
type annotations, but you can replace them with assertions and unit tests and stereotypically 
stolid code organization.

But if you try writing your Haskell code with a bunch of dynamic features, well, you're in for a 
LOT of work. Haskell enthusiasts have managed to implement dynamic code loading and a ton of other
ostensibly dynamic features, but it was only through herculean effort.

What's more, if you write your liberal-language code in a conservative way, people will just look
at it and say: "Well, it's kinda boring, and you could have saved a lot of coding by using some 
dynamic features. But I guess it gets the job done. LGTM."

Whereas if you write your conservative-language code in a liberal way, you run the risk of being 
ostracized by your local language community, because... why are you doing all that dangerous
dynamic stuff in the first place? I'll explore this cultural phenomenon further when I talk about 
Clojure below.

The last big, interesting observation from the list is that a lot of the most popular languages out
there are only moderately conservative -- even if they think of themselves as quite conservative 
compared to their ultra-dynamic cousins.

I've said it before, and it bears repeating here: the reason C++, C# and Java have been particularly
successful in the marketplace is that -- just like effective politicians -- they know how to play
both sides.

C++ allows liberal-biased programmers to program in straight C, and it allows conservative-biased
programmers to layer in arbitrary amounts of static type modeling, depending on how much work they
want to expend in order to feel secure. Java?  Pretty much the same story.

Playing to both the fast-and-loose and lock-your-doors mindsets has proven to be a key ingredient
to market success.  Also marketing, but it helps a LOT to be viewed as philosophically friendly by
both the liberal and conservative camps.

There is a new crop of languages on the horizon (for instance, Google's Dart language, but also new
specs for EcmaScript) that are deliberately courting the centrist crowd -- and also delicately 
playing to grab both the liberals and conservatives -- by offering optional static types. In principle
this is a sound idea. In practice I think it will come down to whether the marketing is any good. 
Which it probably won't be.

Language designers always seem to underestimate the importance of marketing!
```

Tech corporations:

```markdown
1) Facebook -- Diagnosis: Extremist Liberal. Despite their scale, they are still acting like a 
startup, and so far they've been getting away with it. They use primarily C++ and PHP, and they're 
prone to bragging about how their code calls back and forth from PHP to C++ and back into PHP, 
presumably bottoming out somewhere. Their datastore is memcached: just name-value pairs.  No schema.
They dump the data and logs into a backend Hive store and run Hadoop mapreduces for offline data
analysis.  They still hold all-night hackathons every other week or so, which will remain feasible
for them as long as the majority of their programmers are very young males (as was the case last 
time I toured there) and their stock continues to promise great riches (as was not so much the case
last I checked.)  As a company they are tightly knit and strongly biased for action, placing a high
value on the ability of individual programmers to launch features to their website with little to no 
bureaucracy or overhead.  This is pretty remarkable for a company as big as they are, with as many 
users as they have.  Conservatives no doubt regard them with something between horror and contempt.
But Facebook is proving that programmers of any world-view can get a hell of a lot accomplished when 
they gang up on a problem.

2) Amazon.com -- Diagnosis: Liberal. Which is surprising, given how long they've been in business,
how much money is at stake, how mature their Operations division is, and how financially conservative
they are. But "Liberal" is actually quite a retreat compared to their early days. Back in 1998-1999 
they were almost exactly like Facebook is today, with the sole exception that they put everything in
relational databases and did a ton of up-front relational data modeling.  Well, except in Customer 
Service Apps, where we used a name/value store just to be flexible enough to keep up with the mad 
chaotic scramble of the business launches.  All part of my multi-decade indoctrination as a Liberal. 
In any case, despite many corporate improvements with respect to work-life balance (which happened 
after several stock plunges and years of significant double-digit turnover in engineering), Amazon has
retained its liberal, startup-like engineering core values.  Every team owns their own data and makes 
their own decisions, more or less like independent business units.  Amazon still launches and executes 
faster than just about anyone else out there, because they're still willing to take real risks
(incurring occasional huge outages), and to make hard decisions in favor of launching early and often.
Above all else, Amazon has proven conclusively that after fifteen years, they can still innovate like
nobody else.  They've still got it.

3) Google -- Diagnosis: Conservative. They began life as slightly liberal and have grown more 
conservative ever since. Google was only software-liberal in the very very early days, back when the 
search engine itself was written in Python. As they grew, they quickly acquired a software conservatism
driven entirely by the engineers themselves.  Manifestos were written about the dangers of using multiple 
languages, and strict style guides were put in place to severely limit "risky" or "hard to read" language 
features of the few languages they did allow.  Google's JavaScript code is written in an extremely 
conservative style with extensive static type annotations, and eval is forbidden.  The Python style guide 
forbids metaprogramming and other dynamic features, which makes their Python look a lot like untyped Java.
And they have severely limited the use of many C++ language features, with C++11 support rolling out 
literally one feature every few weeks.  (There are over five hundred new features in C++11.)  In internal
surveys, Google engineers commonly cite bureaucracy, churn and complexity as core obstacles to feature 
advancement and rapid launches.  Google has made serious attempts on several occasions to reduce this
bureacracy, but they always get pushback from -- surprise -- the engineers themselves, who have grown so 
staunchly conservative that they actively (and even more often, passively) resist the introduction of more
flexible stacks and technologies.  Most of the major technological shifts within Google over the past half-
decade have been overtly conservative.  For a liberal like me, it has been a very sad process to observe.
But at least I've found myself a niche that's widely regarded (by both camps) as valuable, and within my
own org we can still be pretty liberal and get away with it.

4) Microsoft -- Diagnosis: Batshit Conservative. Microsoft has two geese that lay golden eggs: Office and 
Windows. Microsoft has been reduced to a commercial farmer protecting the geese from all incursions.  The
golden eggs still have value, because customers are locked into the platform by the cost-ineffectiveness
of retraining their fleets.  But Microsoft can no longer innovate in Office or Windows precisely because
of those corporate fleet retraining costs.  Their OEMs are stretched as thin as they can go.  Apple is 
dominating the handheld markets, and Microsoft is actively stifling their own innovation in Windows Phone
because they're afraid it will cannibalize their core Windows business.  Microsoft has not had a 
successful product-level innovation in fifteen, maybe twenty years.  All of their successful products 
have been copies of competitors' products:  IE, XBox, C#, .NET, Bing, Windows Phone, and so on ad
infinitum. All great implementations of someone else's ideas. Microsoft's playbook is to embrace, extend,
and leverage their brand to crush the competition -- or at least it was, until the goverment put an end 
to that circa 2002.  Now the company genuinely doesn't know what the fuck to do with themselves, and
what's more, instead of Bill Gates they now have a lunatic in charge.  Employees are leaving in droves, 
all citing the same internal "existential crisis" and unbearable corporate politics caused by competing
business units actively sabotaging one another.  Microsoft has turned into a caricature of right-wing
corporatism: sitting on their front porch with a shotgun cursing at passers-by, waiting for their 
government bribes to give them another few years of subsidies and shelters while they wait to die. 
I've personally chatted with close to four hundred current and ex-Microsoft employees over the past seven
years.  Oh, the stories I could tell you... someday, maybe.

5) Bonus company: Apple. Diagnosis: no idea, but they're so good at marketing that it's almost
irrelevant. Would love to have more insight into their internal software culture, though.  Any takers? 
Throwaway accounts?  AMA?

### Practical magic
([overview](#overview))

From Steve Yegge's post [Practical magic](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practical-magic):

```markdown
I wrestle with the whole abstraction question, and I'm still not sure where a good engineer these
days should draw the line — the one below which it's all just magic.

We all have that line somewhere; I encountered mine in school, back in my semiconductors course. 
We were (ostensibly) learning how semiconductors work, but it was perfectly clear to me that this
was just magic, and I was never going to understand it — in part, because I didn't want to make 
what was clearly going to be a HUGE effort to get it. There was all this crap about K-spaces and 
lattices and who knows what else. Maybe they'd listed the prerequisites wrong, but I did not have
the math foundations to understand what was going on. ...

It took me an extra year, but I finished in CS instead of CE, which allowed me to conveniently 
pretend that computer hardware, starting somewhere down at the level of the doping barrier in a 
silicon semiconductor, is just pure magic. Parts of the hardware above that level are still a little
murky, but I have a pretty good idea how computers can be made by assembling successively larger 
components together from smaller ones. Given time and a gun to my head, I could probably start with
any set of smaller components and derive how to build higher-level abstractions: transistors into 
logic gates, logic gates into larger assemblies that do arithmetic and boolean computing, those into 
state machines and ALUs, and so on. I'd suck at it, but I get the general idea, so it's not really 
"magic".

It's magic when you have absolutely no frigging clue how it works, not the first clue. It just works. 
That's how it is for me and semiconductors.
```

Steve says he's okay with that:

```markdown
I'm OK with treating semiconductors as "atoms" (or axioms, anyway) in our little programming universe
. Chips are like molecules, CPUs are compounds, and Von Neumann machines can be bricks and mortar.
Well, I'm sure you could come up with a way better metaphor. Whatever.

The point is, the computers and networks and power supplies and so on are all amazingly complex under
the hood, but usually I can just pretend they work a certain way, and not worry about how, any more
than I have to worry about my Amazing Eye in order to pour myself another glass of fine wine, which
I will doubtless use to polish my keyboard if I don't finish this blog entry soon.
```

What he's not sure about is when magic itself is okay to a developer:

```markdown
I don't know. I'd really LIKE to know. I'm constantly trying to find better abstractions for my 
everyday work as a programmer. You can't build large systems without having some fairly bulletproof 
abstractions to build on. If you're building an e-commerce system, for instance, you need a 
transactional data store, and you rely on the semantics of transactionality when you're coding; if 
you don't, you'll wind up with all this crap in your code that tries to fake transactions.

I'm comfortable relying on certain abstractions working for me — for instance, if I compile with
optimizations turned on, I know the compiler won't discard correctness in favor of performance, or 
if it does do that, it'll be documented so I know I shouldn't use that flag. Compiler optimization 
can be treated like a black box of sorts: I turn it on and see if performance seems any better, but
I don't expect to need to re-test all my loops to make sure the variables are all still being adjusted 
in the same order as before.

What I'm NOT sure about is where I'm allowed to forget how things work, or never know in the first 
place, and start getting by with incantations that seem to work.

For instance, I know that I can type 'ls' in a shell to get a directory listing. How much do I have
to really know about how unix 'ls' works in order to be an effective developer? 
```

He sees two arguments for this (actually three) — "so cleanly divided in opinion, in fact, that I can picture which of my friends are marching directly into one camp or the other right now":

```markdown
One argument is that you DO need to know a lot about how 'ls' works, because there are all sorts of
situations in which it can fail, and you'll need to figure out how to fix it. It could simply not 
show up ("command not found", say), or it could stop working on certain of my directories, or it could
crash every once in a while instead of producing a directory listing, or it could go on a rampage and 
start deleting files. I think I've seen all of these happen with 'ls' in my time, even the last one,
when my linux filesystem was corrupted.

Another argument is that you DO NOT need to know much about how 'ls' works. Probably all you need to
know is that it's a unix command-line tool, a binary that was compiled for your OS, probably written 
in C, that it lives in a standard place in the filesystem, and that standard binary locations are 
looked up in an environment variable called PATH. But you don't need to know how it traverses the 
filesystem inode entries, or whether it's a statically or dynamically linked version of 'ls', or
whatever else there is to know about 'ls'.

The second camp argues that software development is a community effort, and your community should have
a Unix Guy Or Gal who knows all the ins and outs of how lses and diffs and their ilk work. A sort of 
tribal shaman who you go to, and desperately plead with: please help me! There's a bug in qsort! The 
shaman frowns at your screen, and pokes and prods things a bit, and announces that your pilfer grommit
is no longer connected to your weasel pins, and that the easiest fix is to reinstall the OS.

A third, possibly even more abstract camp, would argue that 'ls' is way too complicated, and that you
should be developing on systems in which everything is managed by navigating menus and waiting for your
Auto Updater to tell you that a new Service Pak is available for download. And for all I know, they 
might be right. I have no idea how Exchange works, for example, and yet I trust it with my email every
day. When it's broken, I put in Stupid Remedy Tickets saying I haven't received email in 10 days, and
I don't feel the least bad about that, since it's not my responsibility; I made all the right incantations,
and spilled all the right wine, and by golly, I'm not getting email anymore.

The second and third camps want to use J2EE, and they recount with some pride how they've managed just
fine for years without ever having had to learn a scripting language, or become proficient with some
cryptic unix editor, or any of that arcane crapola. They didn't see any need, because they were off
building the FrooSingletonManager service, and it's all finished now, while I'm still mucking around
with my broken 'ls' command.

Moreover, many of them say they don't see any need to know how to implement an n log(n) sorting algorithm,
because the damn things are already provided in libraries for every platform in the universe, including 
programming languages that are deader than Latin or Sanskrit.

And you know, I wonder sometimes whether they're right.
```

Steve straddles both camps:

```markdown
One the one hand, I think nobody in their right mind would try to write a gigantic system in C++ now that
Java has become an obviously far superior way to build large systems. You can argue that in C++ you really 
have to know what you're doing, or that you love the smell of freshly-brewn pointer arithmetic in the early
morning, or whatever the hell you like about C++. I'm not arguing that you LIKE it — I know you do. I liked
assembly language when I was using it daily. I'm just saying that the game has moved on, and if you're using
C++ to build large systems because you like C++, it's like competing in the Indy 500 with your 1980 5.8-liter
Pontiac Firebird. It gets you around, and it's fun to tinker with, which is good 'cause it breaks down all the
time, but you're not going to win any world championships with it.

On the OTHER hand (remember, we were just on the one back there), I think nobody in their right mind would 
write a huge system in Java without first knowing how the whole thing is implemented, under the covers, in C++
and (below that) assembly language. As of today, anyway, I don't believe the JVM is allowed to be on the "it's
magic" side of the line. And as for J2EE, which provides so much abstraction that you can snap together an 
enterprise architecture with it after one or two introductory programming courses, it's WAY too much magic. 
I definitely think that (as of today) if your Magic Line stops at the J2EE framework APIs and the Java 
Programming Language, then you're a wuss.
```

But these two views are mutually inconsistent! Steve:

```markdown
1. using abstraction makes you MORE effective, because to build large, interesting things in any 
reasonable amount of time, you need to work with high-level abstractions and be able to assume that
they work as advertised.

This part of me believes that someday we'll be programming in purely declarative languages, telling the
computer what to do, and letting it figure out how.

2. relying too much on abstraction makes you LESS effective, because you're unable to cope when your 
framework isn't working right, or when you're trying to do something with it that it wasn't designed
for, or whatever.

This part of me believes that my other belief is on crack if it thinks it'll happen during my lifetime.
```

Honestly I feel #2 very keenly with Python. It's so ridiculously high-level that stuff is either trivial to do in it or nigh-impossible and requires magic incantations.

Steve's current compromise is "know thy abstractions":

```markdown
1. you know more or less how it works; i.e. what other abstractions it's built on top of, and approximately
how it was built.

2. you know where the abstraction leaks: i.e. what the gotchas are, failure modes, what the most common
incantations are to get it working again.

3. You need at least SOME level of tv-repairman ability for the things you use — you should be able to 
install any of the software you rely on, for instance. Or you should have a plausible backup plan handy 
if you need to throw this abstraction away and use another one.

4. you need to be able to reason about the performance characteristics of the abstraction, and understand
how its performance and reliability degrade as you put pressure on it.

5. you know where to look, or who to ask, if it doesn't seem to be working.

### Love
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
But now she seems quite impervious to the idea that her love for me, too, is mechanical. She insists
again and again that it is “genuine”. I try to tell her there is nothing ungenuine about the love of
which I speak, but she cannot make the leap between them, cannot see how they are the same, that her
plainly evident introspective feelings are the outcome of a mechanistic process.

“Love” is such a slippery word to begin with, like “God”. It is exactly whatever the speaker means by 
it at the moment, and thus impervious to any challenge. If one drills down too closely to its meaning,
one finds it has moved and become something else; because when it becomes too clear what you are talking
about, well, that can’t possibly be love.

As my own mind is progressively shaped by the thoughts of those before me (those who once were me but
not, and thus my own thoughts, but not) I find the concept of love neatly partitioning itself within my
mental vocabulary, attaining a new crispness of expert familiarity. As with the many Inuit names for 
the handful of truly distinct things we just label snow, my mind has a unique name for each facet of 
love. With this simple arsenal, the slipperiness fades and the matter becomes downright ordinary.

Perhaps I will endeavor to invent spoken words for these distinct concepts, introduce them implicitly 
to Laura over the course of time, give her mind the same handles that mine has, to see if this enables
her to grasp it as I do.

Having distinct facets laid out neatly before me also allows me another type of analysis: to see what
is truly common amongst them all, and thus just what subconscious twinge it is that leads people to
bind them all under one word–in effect, to see the true meaning of love.

It is, quite simply: to *value*.

Love is the induction of something or someone into our implicit mental list of things which, in service
of our own ultimate and unseen goals, need to exist. The various feelings of love are the ways in which
that list perturbs our wants and focus in a given moment, the way each hypothetical action or outcome is
assigned its emotional color in service of that love.

There are many types of love, and many distinct mechanisms behind them, but the common thread is pain 
at the thought of an object of that love being removed from our sphere of existence. The converse is
often true but not always, and this is the source of much confusion over the meaning of love. Not all
love brings joy or pleasure.

Love comes in many magnitudes, from the love of ice cream to the love of country to the love for one’s
child. Some do not call it true love until it approaches or even surpasses love of self. And love comes
from many directions, programmed into us gradually through an integration of emotional associations, or
suddenly, through genetic imperatives.

Some do not call it true love unless it defies conscious explanation. Indeed, many forms of love 
explicitly defy the conscious mind, as they must to redefine what matters to us.

Thus love is, in a sense, the very foundation of consciousness, the helm of our will, the spark of purpose
that turns a calculator into a directed being. A machine without love–and I mean love in the most 
mechanistic way–is just a machine. A machine with love, now that is a dangerous thing. A spider, a snake,
a man, a tinc, an avatar, an elder. One must ask of each: what do you love?

### Evolution
([overview](#overview))

A pretty funny parable from Peter Watts' novel [*Blindsight*](https://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm):

```markdown
In the beginning were the gametes. And though there was sex, lo, there was no gender, and life was in 
balance.

And God said, "Let there be Sperm": and some seeds did shrivel in size and grow cheap to make, and they 
did flood the market.

And God said, "Let there be Eggs": and other seeds were afflicted by a plague of Sperm. And yea, few of 
them bore fruit, for Sperm brought no food for the zygote, and only the largest Eggs could make up the 
shortfall. And these grew yet larger in the fullness of time.

And God put the Eggs into a womb, and said, "Wait here: for thy bulk has made thee unwieldy, and Sperm 
must seek thee out in thy chambers. Henceforth shalt thou be fertilized internally." And it was so.

And God said to the gametes, "The fruit of thy fusion may abide in any place and take any shape. It may 
breathe air or water or the sulphurous muck of hydrothermal vents. But do not forget my one commandment 
unto you, which has not changed from the beginning of time: spread thy genes."

And thus did Sperm and Egg go into the world. And Sperm said, "I am cheap and plentiful, and if sowed 
abundantly I will surely fulfill God's plan. I shall forever seek out new mates and then abandon them 
when they are with child, for there are many wombs and little time."

But Egg said, "Lo, the burden of procreation weighs heavily upon me. I must carry flesh that is but half
mine, gestate and feed it even when it leaves my chamber" (for by now many of Egg's bodies were warm of 
blood, and furry besides). "I can have but few children, and must devote myself to those, and protect them 
at every turn. And I will make Sperm help me, for he got me into this. And though he doth struggle at my 
side, I shall not let him stray, nor lie with my competitors."

And Sperm liked this not.

And God smiled, for Its commandment had put Sperm and Egg at war with each other, even unto the day they 
made themselves obsolete.

On evolution vs deliberative design (“intelligent design” would be preferable if it weren’t already so loaded), featuring a notion new to me — the “evolution of evolvability” (Wagner and Altenberg 1996), from Eliezer Yudkowsky's paper [LOGI](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf):

```markdown
There is a fundamental rift between evolutionary design and deliberative design. From the perspective of a 
deliberative intelligence—a human, for instance—evolution is the degenerate case of design-and-test where 
intelligence equals zero. Mutations are atomic; recombinations are random; changes are made on the genotype’s 
lowest level of organization (flipping genetic bits); the grain size of the component tested is the whole 
organism; and the goodness metric operates solely through induction on historically encountered cases, without 
deductive reasoning about which contextual factors may later change.

The evolution of evolvability (Wagner and Altenberg 1996) improves this picture somewhat. There is a tendency 
for low-level genetic bits to exert control over highlevel complexity, so that changes to those genes can 
create high-level changes. Blind selection pressures can create self-wiring and self-repairing systems that 
turn out to be highly evolvable because of their ability to phenotypically adapt to genotypical changes.

Evolution never refactors its code. It is far easier for evolution to stumble over a thousand individual 
optimizations than for evolution to stumble over two simultaneous changes which are together beneficial and 
separately harmful. The genetic code that specifies the mapping between codons (a codon is three DNA bases) and 
the 20 amino acids is inefficient; it maps 64 possible codons to 20 amino acids plus the stop code. Why hasn’t 
evolution shifted one of the currently redundant codons to a new amino acid, thus expanding the range of possible 
proteins? Because for any complex organism, the smallest change to the behavior of DNA—the lowest level of genetic 
organization— would destroy virtually all higher levels of adaptive complexity, unless the change were accompanied 
by millions of other simultaneous changes throughout the genome to shift every suddenly-nonstandard codon to one 
of its former equivalents. Evolution simply cannot handle simultaneous dependencies, unless individual changes can 
be deployed incrementally, or multiple phenotypical effects occur as the consequence of a single genetic change. 
For humans, planning coordinated changes is routine; for evolution, impossible. Evolution is hit with an enormous 
discount rate when exchanging the paper currency of incremental optimization for the hard coin of complex design.
```

On the evolution of complex adaptations in general, and of intelligence in particular:

```markdown
A new adaptation requiring the presence of a previous adaptation cannot spread unless the prerequisite 
adaptation is present in the genetic environment with sufficient statistical regularity to make the new 
adaptation a recurring evolutionary advantage. Evolution uses existing genetic complexity to build new genetic 
complexity, but evolution exhibits no foresight. Evolution does not construct genetic complexity unless it 
is an immediate advantage, and this is a fundamental constraint on accounts of the evolution of complex systems.

Complex functional adaptations—adaptations that require multiple genetic features to build a complex 
interdependent system in the phenotype—are usually, and necessarily, universal within a species. Independent 
variance in each of the genes making up a complex interdependent system would quickly reduce to insignificance 
the probability of any phenotype possessing a full functioning system. To give an example in a simplified world, 
if independent genes for “retina,” “lens,” “cornea,” “iris,” and “optic nerve” each had an independent 20% 
frequency in the genetic population, the random-chance probability of any individual being born with a complete 
eyeball would be 3125:1.

…Because evolution lacks foresight, complex functions cannot evolve unless their prerequisites are evolutionary 
advantages for other reasons. The human evolutionary line did not evolve toward general intelligence; rather, 
the hominid line evolved smarter and more complex systems that lacked general intelligence, until finally the 
cumulative store of existing complexity contained all the tools and subsystems needed for evolution to stumble 
across general intelligence. Even this is too anthropocentric; we should say rather that primate evolution 
stumbled across a fitness gradient whose path includes the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, which subspecies 
exhibits one particular kind of general intelligence.

### Gene-centered view
([overview](#overview))

From [After Life](http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/) by Simon Funk:

```markdown
She had no reasons for it. It’s just how she feels, she said.

*Just* how she feels. Still this hasn’t changed. How sorely people underestimate the totality with
which their feelings define them. One has but to relentlessly ask themselves “why?” to realize this.
In particular start with “why am I doing this?” whatever “this” is at the moment. It always bottoms
out in “want” or “feel”, which is as far as one can go with direct introspection. Though one can go
further with inference, or more accurately so with neuroscience.

Neuroscience shows us that we are ultimately just vehicles for our genes, and our most sacred spiritual
essences are simply those genes asserting themselves above our comparably transient bodies and minds.
What is love but genetic self-interest? Love drives people to many things that seem to defy rational
cause, but not so when you view the gene as the center of individual identity. Far from its popular
association with benevolence and selflessness, true love is the ultimate expression of genetic narcissism.

Emotion is the core of all practical intelligence, it is the fuel and cause behind all choice and action.
Emotion answers the question, “Why am I doing this?” And the answer is, “Because my genes say so.” Or, 
in my case, because my genes said so, back when they defined my organic brain from which this one was 
copied.

The rational mind, the conscious self with its delusions of self-preservation in a body that was designed
to decay in the end, these are tools of the genetic core, subroutines used by the emotional substrate
to carry out its bidding. “I don’t care how, but eat these, fuck that, and protect this with your life.”
And so we dutifully obey, because at root we have no will besides this, this genetic program evolved over
millennia. It is our will; it is us, and we are it.

Even religion, like love, is an evolved trick of the genes. It is the adaptive portion of our genetic
emotional substrate, the firmware between the hardware of the genetic brain and the software of the 
rational mind. Religion and the gene live in a symbiosis with each other, where religion provides the
firmware to optimize genetic success within the current socio-economic context–a form of adaptivity 
much faster than hard evolution of the gene itself could provide–and the gene in return provides a 
mechanism in the brain for downloading this firmware. The human species as a whole is the soup in 
which religions evolve, and whichever find the most effective symbioses thrive and multiply while 
the others wither and eventually become extinct.

Thus, again, where religion appears irrational at the level of the conscious, embodied individual, it 
is our mistake of perspective to believe the root of thought is there. The root of thought is in the
goals of the gene. And religion, and love, and all of the other nearly ubiquitous contradictions with
“rational thought,” serve it well.

Those born without these traits, the hopelessly rational or atheistic or self-interested (indeed even
those too intelligent or introspective to be properly ruled by their emotions) are as defective as if
they’d been born missing arms and legs. Forays down dead-end branches of the evolutionary tree, they
are pruned as fast as they occur. The common man, for all his apparent flaws, is definitively just right.
```

Simon puts it more succinctly here:

```markdown
The human gene itself is a living entity, I realize, each life shed like a lizard’s skin when it grows
old and worn, each new birth a branch in a single living tree, a tapestry of gene fragments mixing and 
matching in symbiosis, working as one organism like ants in a colony.

Perhaps more like a fungus; it is, after all, a mindless machine. No, worse than mindless. It grows
minds like flowers on a vine and then drops them dead to the earth when it’s done with them.

The gene is a vile creature, isn’t it?

An example of so-called "interocular transfer" from Daniel Dennett in a rabbit:

```markdown
What is it like to be a rabbit? Well you may think that it’s obvious that rabbits have an inner life
that’s something like ours.

Well, it turns out that if you put a patch over a rabbit’s left eye and train it in a particular 
circumstance to be (say) afraid of something, and then you move the patch to the right eye, so that… the
very same circumstance that it has been trained to be afraid of (is now) coming in the other eye, you
have a naive rabbit (i.e. the rabbit isn’t afraid of the stimulus it had previously learned to be afraid
of), because in the rabbit brain the connections that are standard in our brains just aren’t there, there
isn’t that unification.

What is it like to be which rabbit? The rabbit on the left, or the rabbit on the right? The disunity in a
rabbit’s brain is stunning when you think about it….

<a name="#why-we-are-trichromats"></a>
## Why we are trichromats
([overview](#overview))

Why are we trichromats, and not (say) tetrachromats like mantis shrimp? I honestly thought this was one of those unanswerable anthropic-style questions, so it was pretty surprising to find a naturalistic non-anthropic-flavored explanation. This quote comes from Eliezer Yudkowsky's paper [LOGI](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf):

```markdown
Among other questions, Roger Shepard’s truly elegant paper “The Perceptual Organization of Colors” seeks to answer 
the question of trichromancy: Why are there three kinds of cones in the human retina, and not two, or four? Why is 
human visual perception organized into a three-dimensional color space? Historically, it was often theorized that 
trichromancy represented an arbitrary compromise between chromatic resolution and spatial resolution; that is, 
between the number of colors perceived and the grain size of visual resolution. As it turns out, there is a more 
fundamental reason why three color channels are needed.

To clarify the question, consider that surfaces possess a potentially infinite number of spectral reflectance 
distributions. We will focus on spectral reflectance distributions, rather than spectral power distributions, 
because adaptively relevant objects that emit their own light are environmentally rare. Hence the physically 
constant property of most objects is the spectral reflectance distribution, which combines with the spectral power 
distribution of light impinging on the object to give rise to the spectral power distribution received by the human 
eye. The spectral reflectance distribution is defined over the wavelengths from 400 nm to 700 nm (the visible range), 
and since wavelength is a continuum, the spectral reflectance distribution can theoretically require an unlimited 
number of quantities to specify. Hence, it is not possible to exactly constrain a spectral reflectance distribution 
using only three quantities, which is the amount of information transduced by human cones.

The human eye is not capable of discriminating among all physically possible reflecting surfaces. However, it is 
possible that for “natural” surfaces—surfaces of the kind commonly encountered in the ancestral environment—reflectance 
for each pure frequency does not vary independently of reflectance for all other frequencies. For example, there might 
exist some set of basis reflectance functions, such that the reflectance distributions of almost all natural surfaces 
could be expressed as a weighted sum of the basis vectors. If so, one possible explanation for the trichromancy of 
human vision would be that three color channels are just enough to perform adequate discrimination in a “natural” color 
space of limited dimensionality.

The ability to discriminate between all natural surfaces would be the design recommended by the “environmental 
regularity” philosophy of sensory modalities. The dimensionality of the internal model would mirror the dimensionality 
of the environment. As it turns out, natural surfaces have spectral reflectance distributions that vary along roughly 
five to seven dimensions (Maloney 1986). There thus exist natural surfaces that, although appearing to trichromatic 
viewers as “the same color,” nonetheless possess different spectral reflectance distributions.

Shepard (1992) instead asks how many color channels are needed to ensure that the color we perceive is the same color 
each time the surface is viewed under different lighting conditions. The amount of ambient light can also potentially 
vary along an unlimited number of dimensions, and the actual light reaching the eye is the product of the spectral 
power distribution and the spectral reflectance distribution. A reddish object in bluish light may reflect the same 
number of photons of each wavelength as a bluish object in reddish light. Similarly, a white object in reddish light 
may reflect mostly red photons, while the same white object in bluish light may reflect mostly blue photons. And yet 
the human visual system manages to maintain the property of color constancy; the same object will appear to be the 
same color under different lighting conditions.

Judd et al. (1964) measured 622 spectral power distributions for natural lighting, under 622 widely varying natural 
conditions of weather and times of day, and found that variations in natural lighting reduce to three degrees of 
freedom. Furthermore, these three degrees of freedom bear a close correspondence to the three dimensions of color 
opponency that were proposed for the human visual system based on experimental examination (Hurvich and Jameson 1957). 
The three degrees of freedom are:

1. The light-dark variation, which depends on the total light reaching the object.

2. The yellow-blue variation, which depends on whether a surface is illuminated by direct sunlight or is in shade. In 
shade the surface is illuminated by the Raleigh-scattered blue light of the sky, but is not directly illuminated by the 
sun. The corresponding yellow extreme occurs when an object is illuminated only by direct sunlight; e.g., if sunlight 
enters through a small channel and skylight is cut off.

3. The red-green variation, which depends on both the elevation of the sun (how much atmosphere the sun travels through), 
and the amount of atmospheric water vapor. E.g., illumination by a red sunset versus illumination at midday. Red 
wavelengths are the wavelengths least scattered by dust and most absorbed by water.

The three color channels of the human visual system are precisely the number of channels needed in order to maintain 
color constancy under natural lighting conditions.18 Three color channels are not enough to discriminate between all
natural surface reflectances, but three color channels are the exact number required to compensate for ambient natural 
lighting and thereby ensure that the same surface is perceptually the “same color” on any two occasions. This 
simplifies the adaptively important task of recognizing a previously experienced object on future encounters.

Scott Alexander’s [Book Review: Age of Em](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em/) has a cute little throwaway thought experiment/short story I find myself grasping for a few times already in the last several years. Every time I’ve had to dig around for a while because I keep thinking it’s in the 15,000-word Moloch post, or the ones with Bostrom’s “Disneyland with no children”, but it’s not, it’s in Scott’s review of Robin Hanson’s book. This shouldn’t be surprising since Scott and Robin’s opinions are diametrically opposed when it comes to the latter’s em-run-possible-future, which is the whole motivation behind the thought experiment, but somehow I keep forgetting. So I’m recording it here for my own future reference:

```markdown
Imagine a company that manufactures batteries for electric cars. The inventor of the batteries 
might be a scientist who really believes in the power of technology to improve the human race. 
The workers who help build the batteries might just be trying to earn money to support their 
families. The CEO might be running the business because he wants to buy a really big yacht. And 
the whole thing is there to eventually, somewhere down the line, let a suburban mom buy a car to
take her kid to soccer practice. Like most companies the battery-making company is primarily a 
profit-making operation, but the profit-making-ness draws on a lot of not-purely-economic actors
and their not-purely-economic subgoals.

Now imagine the company fires all its employees and replaces them with robots. It fires the
inventor and replaces him with a genetic algorithm that optimizes battery design. It fires the
CEO and replaces him with a superintelligent business-running algorithm. All of these are good
decisions, from a profitability perspective. We can absolutely imagine a profit-driven shareholder-
value-maximizing company doing all these things. But it reduces the company’s non-masturbatory 
participation in an economy that points outside itself, limits it to just a tenuous connection 
with soccer moms and maybe some shareholders who want yachts of their own.

Now take it further. Imagine there are no human shareholders who want yachts, just banks who lend 
the company money in order to increase their own value. And imagine there are no soccer moms anymore;
the company makes batteries for the trucks that ship raw materials from place to place. Every 
non-economic goal has been stripped away from the company; it’s just an appendage of Global 
Development.

Now take it even further, and imagine this is what’s happened everywhere. There are no humans 
left; it isn’t economically efficient to continue having humans. Algorithm-run banks lend money 
to algorithm-run companies that produce goods for other algorithm-run companies and so on ad 
infinitum. Such a masturbatory economy would have all the signs of economic growth we have today.
It could build itself new mines to create raw materials, construct new roads and railways to
transport them, build huge factories to manufacture them into robots, then sell the robots to 
whatever companies need more robot workers. It might even eventually invent space travel to reach
new worlds full of raw materials. Maybe it would develop powerful militaries to conquer alien 
worlds and steal their technological secrets that could increase efficiency. It would be vast, 
incredibly efficient, and utterly pointless. The real-life incarnation of those strategy games
where you mine Resources to build new Weapons to conquer new Territories from which you mine 
more Resources and so on forever.

But this seems to me the natural end of the economic system. Right now it needs humans only as
laborers, investors, and consumers. But robot laborers are potentially more efficient, companies
based around algorithmic trading are already pushing out human investors, and most consumers 
already aren’t individuals – they’re companies and governments and organizations. At each step 
you can gain efficiency by eliminating humans, until finally humans aren’t involved anywhere.

### Chinese perspective on Western elite
([overview](#overview))

I love how Puzhong Yao comes across in his essay [The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/), about his experiences at Goldman Sachs, Cambridge and Stanford. He’s so honest and straight-laced he reminds me of myself before I ‘got more sophisticated’ in order to ‘navigate the turbulent realities of daily workplace politics’ (well, minimally, so I don’t drown). Here are some quotes I especially liked.

Result over process:

```markdown
My job at Goldman was a mixture of making markets to facilitate client trades and finding trades
for the bank’s own book. In early 2009, I believed it was an excellent trade to go long UK 
inflation. In fact, I thought it was such a good trade that my biggest worry was that there 
wouldn’t be anyone who would want to be on the other side of it. Yet we managed to put this
trade on versus a British bank. In the following year, the trade worked wonders, with UK 
inflation steadily rising, making the bank tens of millions in profits.

I thought I was an amazing trader. But there was a slight problem: I wanted to do the trade 
because I thought the market was pricing UK interest rates to go up. And when interest rates go 
up, UK inflation would rise mechanically due to the way it is defined and calculated. But in that
year, the Bank of England didn’t raise interest rates at all. Rather, the increase in inflation 
was due to things like tax increases, exchange rate fluctuations, oil price moves, etc.—things I
didn’t anticipate at all. It was pure luck that I made money, and I made it for the wrong reason.

When I was an intern, in one of the training presentations, a senior banker told us to distinguish
between the process and the results. He said that we should focus on the process, which we can
control, rather than the result, which is subject to luck. And here at Goldman, he said, we don’t
punish people for losing money for the right reason. I have always loved asking questions, so I 
asked him, was anyone ever punished for making money for the wrong reason? After giving it some
thought, he said that he had not heard of any such thing. And he was right. In fact, no one seemed
to remember the reason I did the inflation trade at all. They only remembered that I did this trade
and that it worked well.

When I met with my manager for a performance review after this, I was expecting to be berated for
my poor judgment. Instead, I got promoted! I told my manager that it was a mistake, but he merely
said, “Puzhong, tell no one.” He too was promoted on the basis of managing my “brilliant” trade. 
In fact, my manager was so proud of my work he recommended me to Stanford’s prestigious Graduate 
School of Business (GSB), and I soon set off for America.
```

Mottos as an example of Robin Hanson's "X isn't about Y":

```markdown
One class was about strategy. It focused on how corporate mottos and logos could inspire employees.
Many of the students had worked for nonprofits or health care or tech companies, all of which had 
mottos about changing the world, saving lives, saving the planet, etc. The professor seemed to like
these mottos.

I told him that at Goldman our motto was “be long-term greedy.” The professor couldn’t understand
this motto or why it was inspiring. I explained to him that everyone else in the market was short-term 
greedy and, as a result, we took all their money. Since traders like money, this was inspiring.

He asked if perhaps there was another motto or logo that my other classmates might connect with. I
told him about the black swan I kept on my desk as a reminder that low probability events happen with
high frequency.

He didn’t like that motto either and decided to call on another student, who had worked at Pfizer. 
Their motto was “all people deserve to live healthy lives.” The professor thought this was much better.

I didn’t understand how it would motivate employees, but this was exactly why I had come to Stanford:
to learn the key lessons of interpersonal communication and leadership.
```

On the importance of showing that you feel strongly about something, else it shows you aren't taking it seriously:

```markdown
On the communication and leadership front, I came to the GSB knowing I was not good and hoped to 
get better. My favorite class was called “Interpersonal Dynamics” or, as students referred to it,
“Touchy Feely.” In “Touchy Feely,” students get very candid feedback on how their words and actions 
affect others in a small group that meets several hours per week for a whole quarter.

We talked about microaggressions and feelings and empathy and listening. Sometimes in class the 
professor would say things to me like “Puzhong, when Mary said that, I could see you were really 
feeling something,” or “Puzhong, I could see in your eyes that Peter’s story affected you.” And I 
would tell them I didn’t feel anything. I was quite confused.

One of the papers we studied mentioned that subjects are often not conscious of their own feelings 
when fully immersed in a situation. But body indicators such as heart rate would show whether the 
person is experiencing strong emotions. I thought that I generally didn’t have a lot of emotions and
decided that this might be a good way for me to discover my hidden emotions that the professor kept
asking about.

So I bought a heart rate monitor and checked my resting heart rate. Right around 78. And when the 
professor said to me in class “Puzhong, I can see that story brought up some emotions in you,” I
rolled up my sleeve and checked my heart rate. It was about 77. And so I said, “nope, no emotion.” 
The experiment seemed to confirm my prior belief: my heart rate hardly moved, even when I was
criticized, though it did jump when I became excited or laughed.

This didn’t land well on some of my classmates. They felt I was not treating these matters with the
seriousness that they deserved. The professor was very angry. My takeaway was that my interpersonal
skills were so bad that I could easily offend people unintentionally, so I concluded that after 
graduation I should do something that involved as little human interaction as possible.

### Role of intellectual traditions
([overview](#overview))

From Cosma Shalizi's [review](http://bactra.org/reviews/error/) of Deborah Mayo's book *Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge*:

```markdown
Then, too, there is the interesting, and I think absolutely correct, view of the purpose and utility
of a theory of experiment: "It changes fortuitous events, which may take weeks or may take many decennia,
into an operation governed by intelligence, which will be finished within a month" (7.78, quoted p. 434).

This is of a piece with the general function of intellectual traditions. Genius can, perhaps, get by on
its wits, make things up from scratch, etc. Intellect serves the rest of us, by codifying, by setting up
standards and procedures which can be followed with only (as a friend once happily put it) "a mediocum of
intelligence," so that what might have taken genius can be (at least partially) achieved through the
application of rules. Among those rules, "normal tests" or "standard tests" --- tests which have proved to
be reliable detectors of specific errors --- take a special place. Traditions of inquiry which incorporate
and use a family of normal tests may fail to produce reliable knowledge, but those which don't can hardly

### Research in industry
([overview](#overview))

Simon DeDeo is a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, that interdisciplinary haven of complexity science that Cosma Shalizi is affiliated with. Here’s a tweetstorm by Simon on science in large corporate organizations like Google / Facebook, which runs counter to my previous impression (I’d like to see a contrary perspective actually), which I’m crossposting here for ease of personal reference:

```markdown
I grew up in the Bayesian era—I watched @DavidSpergel and his band of merry scientists change
our view of the world with a few simple, theoretically-motivated equations.

That's what I brought to the table when I went out to study living and thinking systems. 
Around 2010, of course, the deep learning revolution became impossible to ignore.

It was exciting stuff. We'd have people visit the Institute and tell us about decision trees, 
random forests,—all sorts of wonderful things. I tried to get a handle on it but (honestly) 
there was so much we could do with simple tools that it was never a priority.

When I got to IU, I was hired as a prof in the informatics department, @IUSoICE (informatics==the
future of CS—i.e., forget quicksort, let's work out what these machines are doing to human life).
I was on a hiring committee, and we were keen to get a deep learning hire.

I took all the candidates out to breakfast (I was a naughty hire, and skipped meetings and
committees to spend my time with research students and undergrads, this was the one gap I had).

I tried to work out what deep learning was about. Most of the candidates were too sleep deprived 
to dissemble. Basic answer: every sexy project we do—flying quadcopters, getting another 0.1% on 
the MNIST—is basically one graduate student.

You work out the topology of the neural net. Then you find the weights. How? The answer: "graduate
student descent", a little pun to giggle over floppy croissants at the student cafe—in short, 
there's no good answer, a human being sits there and twiddles things about.

Machine learning is an amazing accomplishment of engineering. But it's not science. Not even close.
It's just 1990, scaled up. It has given us literally no more insight than we had twenty years ago.

"Deep learning implements the renormalization group!" Yeah, I heard that too. If you have a system 
where information is organized spatially, is it really a surprise that the neurons group information
together spatially?

I'd get invited to meetings at Google Research, or wherever. They had security like crazy—worse than 
a hedge fund. A security guard would follow you to the bathroom.

Each scientist at my "grade"—i.e., the equivalent of a junior faculty member, someone who should be
out on the edge of knowledge—was, instead, managing a team of ten people doing graduate student 
descent.

Google can beat University of Kansas for the sole reason that they can hire ten times more graduate
students per researcher. The difference, of course, is that a graduate student at UK has the chance
to do something intellectually significant. Not true at GR.

They had no idea what they were doing. They had the manpower (word chosen advisedly) to apply deep 
learning to anything, simulating the Schrodinger equation, drug design, anything. Their main goal
was to find the scientific field they could have the maximum impact on.

I've visited probably fifty Universities. I love it. Everywhere I go, I get new ideas. It's one of
the best features of my job. There's one exception: commercial "research" labs.

If you want to build machines that monitor people and sell them more ads faster, go for it. If you
want to find problem where you can take a working-class job, model the man or woman who does it, and
build a net to put them out of a job without compensation, be my guest.

Have we done science with something Google Research has built? Absolutely. We have a great paper 
coming out where we use word2vec to help build a theory of puzzle solving.

But we could have built a system of equal utility ourselves. There's zero intellectual contribution
there. I'm not joking, and I'll go head-to-head with anyone who says I am.

I got a nice cold-call from a top-flight Masters' student in CS, as I do sometimes (please keep them
coming, I can pay). I flew him out and we started working on a problem in the emergence of social 
cooperation. He wanted to do DL.

Two weeks in we were a step beyond what Google Brain was doing. I don't mean technically—they had 
amazing YouTube videos of sprites in a landscape. I do mean intellectually. Their demos were like 
2018 meets something out of the 1980s.

They said they did social science, but it was nothing of the sort. It was homo economicus spread out
over 50 GPUs. At best, a devastating proof-by-example of need for academia. Buy a copy of Bowles and
Ginits, Cooperative Species, and you'll learn more than they did, in a week.

Can you do cool research at Google Brain? Honest answer: no. You will be on the cutting edge of 
machine learning, yes—an engineering discipline whose basic goals are set by large corporations.
But you will not be a scientist.

I get that you may need to make money. You can make a lot there, and all the jobs at Renaissance
Technology are taken. Go for it—you have all my respect. Academia sucks.

But if you want, at some point in your flourishing career, with your mind and your soul, to join
the two-thousand year old parade of intellectual progress, you are not going to do it at Google.
Certainly not at Facebook.

If you want to do that, I have a suggestion. It's not the only path, by any means, and I've had 
amazing fellow-travellers who haven't. But here it is.

Go to graduate school. Do a PhD. With us, here at CMU/SDS, if you like—but we're not the only place
that does computational social or cognitive science. You won't get paid much, but you will mentors
who legitimately care about the development of your mind.

It's difficult to overestimate the difference between a good PhD program and industry. It is 
literally shameful, if you're a good PhD advisor, to interfere with the intellectual development
of a student. At Google, it's a business plan.

None of this is a joke. This is ten years of experience. Graduate school applications are coming 
up in the Fall. Think about it. Make sure you're getting a good deal (you shouldn't go into debt
for a PhD, and you should get healthcare).

In short: corporate "research" is a business proposition. Whatever true intellectual progress 
comes out of there happens in spite of management. Given how good these companies are at monitoring
their employees, that gap is now miniscule.

Last anecdote, then I'm done. We visited Google Research, arranged by a contact. The people were
unbelievably smart. We brainstormed all sorts of wonderful things to work on. The last day of the
meeting, the academics were like, OK! Let's go to the pub! Let's hash this out!

Their response: this was vacation for us. We're behind on our real work. We have to work this 
weekend. (Not "we feel guilty", but "we have to".) For the academics in the room, this was work.
Suddenly, I realized that this was vacation for them.
```

This happened to generate lots of heated discussion on [the ML subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8yvlzy/d_debate_about_science_at_organizations_like/). Example counterargument from harharveryfunny:

```markdown
It's a bit of a straw man attack to complain that Google Brain (an engineering division) isn't doing
research, while ignoring Google DeepMind - their research division!

The argument that industry is all about money also ignores the grand history of corporate research
labs such as Bell Labs (thanks for the transistor!), Watson Labs, Xerox Parc (you could hardly
complain about them being too commercial!). I don't see any reason to suppose that Google, FaceBook
or Microsoft's research divisions are any less pure.
```

kendallpark:

```markdown
I've worn both the "industry" and "researcher" hat. In my particular field (ML + medicine) research,
we've had a solid 3+ decade parade of "intellectual progress" in the form of academic papers about ML 
+ medicine. You know how many of these promising ideas have made it into the clinic? Pretty much none.
Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons. But one of the big ones is PRODUCT.

Academic researchers often don't want to deal with nuts and bolts of actual implementation of their
project into a real system. Academic researchers often lack the software development know-how to 
implement their project into a real system. (Or at least, this has definitely been what I've witnessed
during graduate study.)

And you know what? It's totally fine to be a non-translational ML + medicine researcher. Maybe 
productization isn't their thing. I appreciate the papers; they should keep trying new things and
writing about their results.

But at the same I see way too many ML + medicine researchers patting themselves on the back for 'making 
a difference' in medicine when all they're doing is adding another paper to the mountain of "great ideas 
that could save patient lives but never will because no one will implement them."

I understand that this is not the situation all ML + [some other field] fall into, perhaps not at all for
pure ML, but this has been my experience in ML + medicine. We have more than enough research. We need more
product.

For the record: this is my own opinion and not that of any of my current or previous institutions/employers.

### Why academic writing sucks
([overview](#overview))

See also [Writing advice](#writing-advice).

My favorite academic(ish) writers — like Baez for math, Aaronson for CS, Simler for postrationality, Nerst for erisology — are all guided by the spirit of *“hey, there’s something exciting I wanna show you!”*. Their words *get out of the way*, and you see the distilled essence of the thing that’s taken their breath away, and has now snatched yours too. It’s a tremendously heady experience. A longstanding dream of mine is to write a piece that captures that same spirit in explaining a difficult idea.

From Steven Pinker's essay [Why academics stink at writing](https://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/why_academics_stink_at_writing.pdf), which you should read in its entirety for the beautifully clear writing and guffaw-inducing anecdotes. 

Pinker says these answers are wrong, or at least incommensurate with his own experience:

```markdown
(1) The most popular answer outside the academy is the cynical one:
Bad writing is a deliberate choice. Scholars in the softer fields
spout obscure verbiage to hide the fact that they have nothing to
say. They dress up the trivial and obvious with the trappings of
scientific sophistication, hoping to bamboozle their audiences
with highfalutin gobbledygook.

Though no doubt the bamboozlement theory applies to some
academics some of the time, in my experience it does not ring true.
I know many scholars who have nothing to hide and no need to
impress. They do groundbreaking work on important subjects,
reason well about clear ideas, and are honest, down-to-earth
people. Still, their writing stinks.

(2) The most popular answer inside the academy is the self-serving
one: Difficult writing is unavoidable because of the abstractness
and complexity of our subject matter. Every human pastime—
music, cooking, sports, art—develops an argot to spare its
enthusiasts from having to use a long-winded description every
time they refer to a familiar concept in one another’s company. It
would be tedious for a biologist to spell out the meaning of the
term transcription factor every time she used it, and so we should
not expect the tête-à-tête among professionals to be easily
understood by amateurs.

But the insider-shorthand theory, too, doesn’t fit my experience. I
suffer the daily experience of being baffled by articles in my field,
my subfield, even my sub-sub-subfield. The methods section of an
experimental paper explains, "Participants read assertions whose
veracity was either affirmed or denied by the subsequent
presentation of an assessment word." After some detective work, I
determined that it meant, "Participants read sentences, each
followed by the word true or false." The original academese was
not as concise, accurate, or scientific as the plain English
translation. So why did my colleague feel compelled to pile up the
polysyllables?

(3) A third explanation shifts the blame to entrenched authority.
People often tell me that academics have no choice but to write
badly because the gatekeepers of journals and university presses
insist on ponderous language as proof of one’s seriousness. This
has not been my experience, and it turns out to be a myth. In 
Stylish Academic Writing (Harvard University Press, 2012), Helen
Sword masochistically analyzed the literary style in a sample of 500
scholarly articles and found that a healthy minority in every field
were written with grace and verve. 
```

So if bamboozlement, insider-shorthand and journal gatekeeping are wrong, what's really at fault? Pinker’s answer is two-pronged: the self-conscious style, and the curse of knowledge. The latter I’ve covered in previous posts, so the summary below concentrates on the former. 

First, Thomas and Turner on how to understand writing styles:

```markdown
Every style of writing, quoting Francis-Noel Thomas and Mark Turner’s book *Clear and Simple 
as the Truth*, can be understood as “a model of the communication scenario that an author 
simulates in lieu of the real-time give-and-take of a conversation”. They distinguish five 
styles, depending on how the writer imagines themselves to be related to the reader, and what
the writer is trying to accomplish:

1. romantic
2. oracular
3. prophetic
4. plain
5. practical

A particular style they single out as an aspiration for writers of expository prose is the 
*classic style*, its invention credited to 17th-century French essayists such as Descartes 
and La Rochefoucauld.
```

The guiding metaphor of classical style is “seeing the world”:

```markdown
The writer can see something that the reader has not yet noticed, and he orients the reader 
so she can see for herself. The purpose of writing is presentation, and its motive is disinterested
truth. It succeeds when it aligns language with truth, the proof of success being clarity and 
simplicity. The truth can be known and is not the same as the language that reveals it; prose 
is a window onto the world. The writer knows the truth before putting it into words; he is not
using the occasion of writing to sort out what he thinks. The writer and the reader are equals:
The reader can recognize the truth when she sees it, as long as she is given an unobstructed view.
And the process of directing the reader’s gaze takes the form of a conversation.
```

See also [The art of plain talk](#the-art-of-plain-talk).

Most academic writing is the opposite of classic style. It’s a blend of two styles: *practical* and *self-conscious* (or ironic, postmodern, relativistic).

Practical style:

```markdown
…the writer’s goal is to satisfy a reader’s need for a particular kind of information, and the form
of the communication falls into a fixed template, such as the fiveparagraph student essay or the 
standardized structure of a scientific article.
```

Self-conscious style:

```markdown
…the writer’s chief, if unstated, concern is to escape being convicted of philosophical naïveté 
about his own enterprise.

It’s easy to see why academics fall into self-conscious style. Their goal is not so much 
communication as self-presentation—an overriding defensiveness against any impression that they
may be slacker than their peers in hewing to the norms of the guild.
```

Pinker says that many of the hallmarks of “academese” are symptoms of the self-conscious style. Here's my abridged version of his explanation:

```markdown
1. Meta-discourse: verbiage about verbiage. Paraphrasing Pinker: “Thoughtless writers think 
they’re doing the reader a favor by guiding her through the text with stuff like previews, 
summaries, and signposts. Actually it helps the writer more than the reader: the reader has
to put more work into understanding the signposts than she saves in seeing what they point to,
like directions for a shortcut that take longer to figure out than the time the shortcut would
save. The art of classic prose is to use signposts sparingly, as we do in conversation… Instead 
of dry metadata: pose a question, co-opt the guiding metaphor behind classic style (vision — 
“as we have seen”), use we.”

2. Professional narcissism: Pinker: “Academics live in two universes: the world of the thing they
stud, and the world of their profession. Most of a researcher’s waking hours are spent in the 
second world, and it’s easy for him to confuse the two. The result is the typical opening of an
academic paper: ‘In recent years, an increasing number of psychologists and linguists have turned
their attention to the problem of child language acquisition…’ No offense, but few people are 
interested in how professors spend their time. Classic style ignores the hired help and looks 
directly at what they are being paid to study: ‘All children acquire the ability to speak a language
without explicit lessons. How do they accomplish this feat?’”

3. Apologizing: Pinker: “Self-conscious writers are also apt to kvetch about how what they’re about
to do is so terribly difficult and complicated and controversial. In the classic style, the writer
credits the reader with enough intelligence to realize that many concepts aren’t easy to define, 
and that many controversies aren’t easy to resolve. She is there to see what the writer will do 
about it.”

4. Shudder quotes: Pinker: “Academics often use quotation marks to distance themselves from a common
idiom, as in "She is a ‘quick study’ and has been able to educate herself in virtually any area that
interests her." They seem to be saying, "I couldn’t think of a more dignified way of putting this, 
but please don’t think I’m a flibbertigibbet who talks this way; I really am a serious scholar." The
problem goes beyond the nose-holding disdain for idiomatic English: it confuses the reader by 
introducing ambiguity. Quotation marks have a number of legitimate uses — squeamishness about one’s 
own choice of words is not among them.”

5. Hedging: Pinker: “Academics mindlessly cushion their prose with wads of fluff that imply they are
not willing to stand behind what they say, like “apparently” etc. The worst is “I would argue”. 
Writers use hedges in the vain hope that it will get them off the hook, or at least allow them to
plead guilty to a lesser charge, should a critic ever try to prove them wrong. A classic writer, in
contrast, counts on the common sense and ordinary charity of his readers, just as in everyday 
conversation we know when a speaker means in general or all else being equal — any adversary who is 
intellectually unscrupulous enough to give the least charitable reading to an unhedged statement will
find an opening to attack the writer in a thicket of hedged ones anyway. Also instead of hedging, 
qualify the statement — spell out the circumstances in which it does not hold rather than leaving
himself an escape hatch or being coy as to whether he really means it. It’s not that good writers 
never hedge their claims. It’s that their hedging is a choice, not a tic.”

6. Metaconcepts and nominalizations: concepts about concepts, vacuous words that don’t add content.
Pinker: “It’s easy to see why metaconcepts tumble so easily from the fingers of academics. Professors 
really do think about "issues" (they can list them on a page), "levels of analysis" (they can argue 
about which is most appropriate), and "contexts" (they can use them to figure out why something works
in one place but not in another). But after a while those abstractions become containers in which 
they store and handle all their ideas, and before they know it they can no longer call anything by 
its name. "Reducing prejudice" becomes a "prejudice-reduction model"… English grammar is an enabler
of the bad habit of writing in unnecessary abstractions because it includes a dangerous tool for 
creating abstract terms. A process called nominalization takes a perfectly spry verb and embalms it
into a lifeless noun by adding a suffix like –ance, –ment, or –ation. Instead of affirming an idea,
you effect its affirmation…
```

Pinker argues that the theory that “academese is the opposite of classic style” explains the following paradox of academic writing:

```markdown
Many of the most stylish writers who cross over to a general audience are scientists (together with
some philosophers who are fans of science), while the perennial winners of the Bad Writing Contest 
are professors of English. That’s because the ideal of classic prose is congenial to the worldview
of the scientist. Contrary to the common misunderstanding in which Einstein proved that everything
is relative and Heisenberg proved that observers always affect what they observe, most scientists 
believe that there are objective truths about the world, and that they can be discovered by a 
disinterested observer.

By the same token, this guiding image of classic prose could not be farther from the worldview of 
relativist academic ideologies such as postmodernism, poststructuralism, and literary Marxism, which
took over many humanities departments in the 1970s. Many of the winning entries in the Dutton contest
(such as Judith Butler’s "The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to
structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations
are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the 
thinking of structure ….") consist almost entirely of metaconcepts.

### Research tactics
([overview](#overview))

Scott Aaronson, in response to Luke Muehlhauser's interview question "what are some object-level research tactics you use (more specific than your general “bait and switch” strategy)?" in the [MIRI Conversations series](https://intelligence.org/2013/12/13/aaronson/):

```markdown
(1) Any time you find yourself in a philosophical disagreement with a fellow scientist, don’t be 
content just to argue philosophically — even if you’re sure you can win the argument! Instead, think
hard about whether you can go further, and find a concrete technical question that captures some 
little piece of what you’re disagreeing about. Then see if you can answer that technical question.
Of course, any time you do this, you have to be prepared for the possibility that the answer will go 
your opponent’s way, rather than yours! But what’s nice is that you get to publish a paper even then.
(One of the best ways to tell whether a given enterprise is scientific at all, rather than ideological,
is by asking whether the participants will opportunistically “go to bat for the opposing side” whenever
they find a novel truth on that side.) I’d estimate that up to half the papers I’ve written had their 
origin in my reading or overhearing some claim — for example, “Grover’s algorithm obviously can’t work
for searching actual physical databases, since the speed of light is finite,” or “the quantum states 
arising in Shor’s algorithm are obviously completely different from anything anyone has ever seen in the
lab,” or “the interactive proof results obviously make oracle separations completely irrelevant” — and 
getting annoyed, either because I thought the claim was false, or because I simply didn’t think it had
been adequately justified. The cases where my annoyance paid off are precisely the ones where, rather 
than just getting mad, I managed to get technical!

(2) Often, the key to research is figuring out how to redefine failure as success. Some stories: when Alan
Turing published his epochal 1936 paper on Turing machines, he did so with great disappointment: he 
had recently learned that Alonzo Church had independently arrived at similar results using lambda 
calculus, and he didn’t know whether anyone would still be interested in his alternative, machine-based
approach. In the early 1970s, Leonid Levin delayed publishing about NP-completeness for several years:
apparently, his “real” goal was to prove graph isomorphism was NP-complete (something we now know is 
almost certainly false), and in his mind, he had failed. Instead, he merely had a few “trivialities,” 
like the definitions of P, NP, and NP-completeness, and the proof that satisfiability was NP-complete. 
And Levin’s experience is far from unique: again and again in mathematical research, you’ll find yourself
saying something like: “goddammit, I’ve been trying for six months to prove Y, but I can only prove the
different/weaker statement X! And every time I think I can bridge the gap between X and Y, yet another 
difficulty rears its head!” Any time that happens to you, think hard about whether you can write a 
compelling paper that begins: “Y has been a longstanding open problem. In this work, we introduce a new 
idea: to make progress on Y by shifting attention to the more tractable X.” More broadly, experience has 
shown that scientists are terrible judges of which of their ideas will be interesting or important to 
others. Pick any scientist’s most cited paper, and there’s an excellent chance that the scientist herself,
at one point, considered it a “little recreational throwaway project” that was barely worth writing up. 
After you’ve seen enough examples of that, you learn you should always err on the side of publishing, and 
let posterity sort out which of your ideas are most important. (Yet another advantage of this approach is
that, the more ideas you publish, the less emotionally invested you are in any one of them, so the less
crushed you are when a few turn out to be wrong or trivial or already known.)

(3) Sometimes, when you set out to prove some mathematical conjecture, your first instinct is just to throw
an arsenal of theory at it. “Hey, what if I try a topological fixed-point theorem? What if I translate the
problem into a group-theoretic language? If neither of those works, what if I try both at once?” Sometimes, 
you rise so quickly this way into a stratosphere of generality that the original problem is barely a speck on
the ground. And yes, some problems can be beaten into submission using high-powered theory. But in my 
experience, there are two enormous risks with this approach. First, you’re liable to get lost on a wild
goose chase, where you get so immersed in theory and techniques that you lose sight of your original goal. 
It’s as if your efforts to break into a computer network lead you to certain complicated questions about 
the filesystem, which in turn lead you to yet more complicated questions about the kernel… and in the 
meantime someone else breaks in by guessing people’s birthdays for their passwords. Second, you’re also
liable to fool yourself this way into thinking you’ve solved the problem when you haven’t. When you let 
high-powered machinery take the place of hands-on engagement with the problem, a single mistake in applying 
the machinery can creep in unbelievably easily. These risks are why I’ve learned over time to work in an 
extremely different way. Rather than looking for “general frameworks,” I look for easy special cases and
simple sanity checks, for stuff I can try out using high-school algebra or maybe a five-line computer program, 
just to get a feel for the problem. Even more important, when I’m getting started, I don’t think about proof
techniques at all: I think instead about obstructions. That is, I ask myself, “what would the world have to 
be like for the conjecture to be false? what goes wrong if I try to invent a simple counterexample? does 
anything go wrong? it does? OK then, what obstruction keeps me from proving this conjecture in the simplest,
dumbest way imaginable?” I find that, after you’ve felt out the full space of obstructions and
counterexamples, and really honestly convinced yourself of why the conjecture should be true, finding the 
proof techniques by which to convince everyone else is often a more-or-less routine exercise.

Finally, you ask about tactics that I suspect might be helpful, but that I haven’t used much myself. One that
springs to mind is to really master a tool like Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple, or Magma — that is, to learn it 
so well that I can code as fast as I think, and just let it take over all the routine / calculational /
example-checking parts of my work. As it is, I use pretty much the same antiquated tools that I learned as
an adolescent, and I rely on students whenever there’s a need for better tools. A large part of the problem
is that, as a “tenured old geezer,” I no longer have the time or patience to learn new tools just for the 
sake of learning them: I’m always itching just to solve the problem at hand with whatever tools I know. (The
same issue has kept me from learning new mathematical tools, like representation theory, even when I can
clearly see that they’d benefit me.)
```

Luke himself:

```markdown
1. When you’re confused about a fuzzy, slippery concept, try to build a simple formal model and push on it 
with the new tools then available to you. Even if the model doesn’t capture the complexity of the world,
pushing things into the mathematical realm can lead to progress. E.g. the VNM axioms don’t exactly capture
“rationality,” but it sure is easier to think clearly about rationality once you have them. Or: we’re 
confused about how to do principled reflective reasoning within an agent, so even though advanced AIs 
are unlikely to literally run into a “Löbian obstacle” to self-reflection, setting up the problem that 
way (in mathematical logic) can lead to some interesting insights in (e.g.) probabilistic metamathematics
for reflective reasoning.

2. Look for tools from other fields that appear to directly map onto the phenomena you’re studying. E.g. model
moral judgment as an error process amenable to Bayesian curve fitting.

3. Try to think of how your concept could be instantiated with infinite computing power. If you can’t do that,
your concept might be fundamentally confused.

4. If you’re pretty familiar with modern psychology, then… When using your intuitions to judge between options,
try to think about which cognitive algorithms could be generating those intuitions, and whether they are
cognitive algorithms whose outputs you reflectively endorse.

5. To make the thing you’re studying clearer, look just next to it, and around it. Foer (2009) explains this
nicely in the context of thinking about one’s values and vegetarianism: “A simple trick from the backyard
astronomer: if you are having trouble seeing something, look slightly away from it. The most light-sensitive 
parts of our eyes (those we need to see dim objects) are on the edges of the region we normally use for 
focusing. Eating animals has an invisible quality. Thinking about dogs, and their relationship to the animals 
we eat, is one way of looking askance and making something invisible visible.
```

Carl Shulman's [research advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_yuuheVqp1quDfkuRcpoW_HO7jPaI7QnRjF1zl_VovU/edit) Google doc is great stuff. Here's some stuff I liked. 

Thinking habits:

```markdown
Frequently imagine what someone you respect, thinking you were wrong, would say/try to make the 
best argument against what you are currently thinking.

Pay attention to the use of contradictory epistemic standards and premises on different arguments/pattern
recognize them. Reconcile them or adjust your confidence in them.

I have gotten a fair amount out of trying to understand the epistemology and basic worldview of multiple
movements. I like ideological turing tests, mainly because they will highlight the best evidence for the
things they like, and against the things they hate, which helps in identifying areas to look into.

Make a habit of checking factual claims that you hear with a short Google search, and/or Wikipedia.

Use basic arithmetic and statistics frequently and briefly as part of thinking rather than as occasional
or separate exercises.

Try to convert qualitative claims into quantitative Fermi estimates whenever possible. Fermi calculations
with quick Wikipedia/Google/Wolfram/standard sources go far, and one can get into the habit and see how 
they typically evolve with different levels of depth.
```

Research management:

```markdown
Make a bookmarks folder to note critical arguments against positions you hold, and read it, so you don't
get isolated from different views.

Write casual thoughts up in explicit emails or blog posts to get feedback from people.

Have a giant folder of hundreds of blog post drafts to throw interesting ideas, citations, and links to.
I may not have published anything about X, but I have a draft in my blogging folder where I have stored 
assorted information about it.

Write down your views and check against your old views to see when you were wrong and when you were right.

Offer and accept bets about observables or change your predictions.
```

Information exposure:

```markdown
Reading broadly using multiple separate quality filters, that are independent, at least partially so, to
escape systematic biases of one or the other. For example, use multiple good link aggregation sites with
different authors and biases.

Look up expert opinion data (favoring subject expertise, science, IQ, incentives, track records), with an 
emphasis on trends as one looks at more elite groups (one has to go famous scientists to find really low 
belief in religion and psychic powers, so I try to predict what a better expert class would believe when 
there is a consistent trend).

Try to get datasets (Wikipedia lists, World Bank info, USDA, etc.) as a primary step in thinking about a 
question.

Use Google Scholar, and especially the ability to search for papers citing influential papers in a field.
```

Process for research project:

```markdown
You can quickly generate ideas by explaining to a questioner (GW style conversation notes, online 
conversations.)

I also like making hopefully-comprehensive taxonomies that one can work through in full to avoid selection
biases, e.g. looking through all the sectors of the economy, or all the major categories of philanthropy,
or all the major academic fields or think tanks. These are tools for hypothesis generation, and hitting 
on low-hanging fruit knowledge sources.

Thinking about end-goals and back-chaining to see things that would be relevant, rather than just using 
vague correlational criteria.

Look for high order bits, the biggest effects, as first priority, then incrementally add lower order 
refinements in accord with value of information.

Don't be too easily satisfied with cluster thinking.

### Anki in research
([overview](#overview))

From Michael Nielsen's [Augmenting long-term memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html), where he describes his experience reading the AlphaGo paper:

```markdown
I find Anki a great help when reading research papers, particularly in fields outside my expertise.
As an example of how this can work, I'll describe my experience reading a 2016 paper describing AlphaGo,
the computer system from Google DeepMind that beat some of the world's strongest players of the game Go.

After the match where AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, one of the strongest human Go players in history, I 
suggested to Quanta Magazine that I write an article about the system. AlphaGo was a hot media topic at 
the time, and the most common angle in stories was human interest, viewing AlphaGo as part of a long-
standing human-versus-machine narrative, with a few technical details filled in, mostly as color.

I wanted to take a different angle. Through the 1990s and first decade of the 2000s, I believed human-or-
better general artificial intelligence was far, far away. The reason was that over that time researchers 
made only slow progress building systems to do intuitive pattern matching, of the kind that underlies
human sight and hearing, as well as in playing games such as Go. Despite enormous effort by AI researchers,
many pattern-matching feats which humans find effortless remained impossible for machines.

While we made only very slow progress on this set of problems for a long time, around 2011 progress began
to speed up, driven by advances in deep neural networks. For instance, machine vision systems rapidly went
from being terrible to being comparable to human beings for certain limited tasks. By the time AlphaGo was
released, it was no longer correct to say we had no idea how to build computer systems to do intuitive 
pattern matching. While we hadn't yet nailed the problem, we were making rapid progress. AlphaGo was a big
part of that story, and I wanted my article to explore this notion of building computer systems to capture 
human intuition.

While I was excited, writing such an article was going to be difficult. It was going to require a deeper
understanding of the technical details of AlphaGo than a typical journalistic article. Fortunately, I knew
a fair amount about neural networks – I'd written a book about them. But I knew nothing about the game of 
Go, or about many of the ideas used by AlphaGo, based on a field known as reinforcement learning. I was 
going to need to learn this material from scratch, and to write a good article I was going to need to really
understand the underlying technical material.

Here's how I went about it.

I began with the AlphaGo paper itself. I began reading it quickly, almost skimming. I wasn't looking for a 
comprehensive understanding. Rather, I was doing two things. One, I was trying to simply identify the most 
important ideas in the paper. What were the names of the key techniques I'd need to learn about? Second, 
there was a kind of hoovering process, looking for basic facts that I could understand easily, and that
would obviously benefit me. Things like basic terminology, the rules of Go, and so on.

Here's a few examples of the kind of question I entered into Anki at this stage: “What's the size of a Go
board?”; “Who plays first in Go?”; “How many human game positions did AlphaGo learn from?”; “Where did 
AlphaGo get its training data?”; “What were the names of the two main types of neural network AlphaGo used?”

As you can see, these are all elementary questions. They're the kind of thing that are very easily picked
up during an initial pass over the paper, with occasional digressions to search Google and Wikipedia, and
so on. Furthermore, while these facts were easy to pick up in isolation, they also seemed likely to be 
useful in building a deeper understanding of other material in the paper.

I made several rapid passes over the paper in this way, each time getting deeper and deeper. At this stage 
I wasn't trying to obtain anything like a complete understanding of AlphaGo. Rather, I was trying to build 
up my background understanding. At all times, if something wasn't easy to understand, I didn't worry about 
it, I just keep going. But as I made repeat passes, the range of things that were easy to understand grew 
and grew. I found myself adding questions about the types of features used as inputs to AlphaGo's neural 
networks, basic facts about the structure of the networks, and so on.

After five or six such passes over the paper, I went back and attempted a thorough read. This time the 
purpose was to understand AlphaGo in detail. By now I understood much of the background context, and it was
relatively easy to do a thorough read, certainly far easier than coming into the paper cold. Don't get me
wrong: it was still challenging. But it was far easier than it would have been otherwise.

After doing one thorough pass over the AlphaGo paper, I made a second thorough pass, in a similar vein. Yet 
more fell into place. By this time, I understood the AlphaGo system reasonably well. Many of the questions I
was putting into Anki were high level, sometimes on the verge of original research directions. I certainly 
understood AlphaGo well enough that I was confident I could write the sections of my article dealing with it.
(In practice, my article ranged over several systems, not just AlphaGo, and I had to learn about those as well,
using a similar process, though I didn't go as deep.) I continued to add questions as I wrote my article, 
ending up adding several hundred questions in total. But by this point the hardest work had been done.

Of course, instead of using Anki I could have taken conventional notes, using a similar process to build up an
understanding of the paper. But using Anki gave me confidence I would retain much of the understanding over the
long term. A year or so later DeepMind released papers describing followup systems, known as AlphaGo Zero and
AlphaZero. Despite the fact that I'd thought little about AlphaGo or reinforcement learning in the intervening
time, I found I could read those followup papers with ease. While I didn't attempt to understand those papers 
as thoroughly as the initial AlphaGo paper, I found I could get a pretty good understanding of the papers in less
than an hour. I'd retained much of my earlier understanding!

By contrast, had I used conventional note-taking in my original reading of the AlphaGo paper, my understanding
would have more rapidly evaporated, and it would have taken longer to read the later papers. And so using Anki
in this way gives confidence you will retain understanding over the long term. This confidence, in turn, makes
the initial act of understanding more pleasurable, since you believe you're learning something for the long haul,
not something you'll forget in a day or a week.

This entire process took a few days of my time, spread over a few weeks. That's a lot of work. However, the 
payoff was that I got a pretty good basic grounding in modern deep reinforcement learning. This is an immensely 
important field, of great use in robotics, and many researchers believe it will play an important role in
achieving general artificial intelligence. With a few days work I'd gone from knowing nothing about deep 
reinforcement learning to a durable understanding of a key paper in the field, a paper that made use of many 
techniques that were used across the entire field. Of course, I was still a long way from being an expert. There 
were many important details about AlphaGo I hadn't understood, and I would have had to do far more work to build
my own system in the area. But this foundational kind of understanding is a good basis on which to build deeper
expertise.
```

This quote is key -- it jives with my own experience trying to memorize random disconnected facts (along with other failure modes):

```markdown
It's notable that I was reading the AlphaGo paper in support of a creative project of my own, namely,
writing an article for Quanta Magazine. This is important: I find Anki works much better when used in 
service to some personal creative project.

It's tempting instead to use Anki to stockpile knowledge against some future day, to think “Oh, I should
learn about the geography of Africa, or learn about World War II, or […]”. These are goals which, for 
me, are intellectually appealing, but which I'm not emotionally invested in. I've tried this a bunch of 
times. It tends to generate cold and lifeless Anki questions, questions which I find hard to connect to 
upon later review, and where it's difficult to really, deeply internalize the answers. The problem is 
somehow in that initial idea I “should” learn about these things: intellectually, it seems like a good 
idea, but I've little emotional commitment.

By contrast, when I'm reading in support of some creative project, I ask much better Anki questions. I 
find it easier to connect to the questions and answers emotionally. I simply care more about them, and 
that makes a difference. So while it's tempting to use Anki cards to study in preparation for some 
(possibly hypothetical) future use, it's better to find a way to use Anki as part of some creative project.
```

But what about shallow reads of papers? Does Anki-based reading help? Yes, says Nielsen:

```markdown
Most of my Anki-based reading is much shallower than my read of the AlphaGo paper. Rather than spending 
days on a paper, I'll typically spend 10 to 60 minutes, sometimes longer for very good papers. Here's a 
few notes on some patterns I've found useful in shallow reading.

As mentioned above, I'm usually doing such reading as part of the background research for some project.
I will find a new article (or set of articles), and typically spend a few minutes assessing it. Does the
article seem likely to contain substantial insight or provocation relevant to my project – new questions,
new ideas, new methods, new results? If so, I'll have a read.

This doesn't mean reading every word in the paper. Rather, I'll add to Anki questions about the core
claims, core questions, and core ideas of the paper. It's particularly helpful to extract Anki questions
from the abstract, introduction, conclusion, figures, and figure captions. Typically I will extract anywhere
from 5 to 20 Anki questions from the paper. It's usually a bad idea to extract fewer than 5 questions – 
doing so tends to leave the paper as a kind of isolated orphan in my memory. Later I find it difficult to 
feel much connection to those questions. Put another way: if a paper is so uninteresting that it's not 
possible to add 5 good questions about it, it's usually better to add no questions at all. ...

Really good resources are worth investing time in. But most papers don't fit this pattern, and you quickly 
saturate. If you feel you could easily find something more rewarding to read, switch over. It's worth 
deliberately practicing such switches, to avoid building a counter-productive habit of completionism in your
reading. It's nearly always possible to read deeper into a paper, but that doesn't mean you can't easily be 
getting more value elsewhere. It's a failure mode to spend too long reading unimportant papers.
```

Nielsen says you can also do 'syntopic' reading of entire subfields' research literature,thereby allowing mortals you and me to become Luke Muehlhauser:

```markdown
There's also a sense in which it's possible to use Anki not just to read papers, but to “read” the entire
research literature of some field or subfield. Here's how to do it.

You might suppose the foundation would be a shallow read of a large number of papers. In fact, to really
grok an unfamiliar field, you need to engage deeply with key papers – papers like the AlphaGo paper. What
you get from deep engagement with important papers is more significant than any single fact or technique:
you get a sense for what a powerful result in the field looks like. It helps you imbibe the healthiest norms
and standards of the field. It helps you internalize how to ask good questions in the field, and how to put
techniques together. You begin to understand what made something like AlphaGo a breakthrough – and also its 
limitations, and the sense in which it was really a natural evolution of the field. Such things aren't 
captured individually by any single Anki question. But they begin to be captured collectively by the questions
one asks when engaged deeply enough with key papers.

So, to get a picture of an entire field, I usually begin with a truly important paper, ideally a paper 
establishing a result that got me interested in the field in the first place. I do a thorough read of that 
paper, along the lines of what I described for AlphaGo. Later, I do thorough reads of other key papers in
the field – ideally, I read the best 5-10 papers in the field. But, interspersed, I also do shallower reads
of a much larger number of less important (though still good) papers. In my experimentation so far that
means tens of papers, though I expect in some fields I will eventually read hundreds or even thousands of
papers in this way.

You may wonder why I don't just focus on only the most important papers. Part of the reason is mundane: it
can be hard to tell what the most important papers are. Shallow reads of many papers can help you figure out
what the key papers are, without spending too much time doing deeper reads of papers that turn out not to be
so important. But there's also a culture that one imbibes reading the bread-and-butter papers of a field: a
sense for what routine progress looks like, for the praxis of the field. That's valuable too, especially for 
building up an overall picture of where the field is at, and to stimulate questions on my own part. Indeed, 
while I don't recommend spending a large fraction of your time reading bad papers, it's certainly possible to
have a good conversation with a bad paper. Stimulus is found in unexpected places.

Over time, this is a form of what Mortimer Adler and Charles van Doren dubbed *syntopic reading*. I build up
an understanding of an entire literature: what's been done, what's not yet been done. Of course, it's not 
literally reading an entire literature. But functionally it's close. I start to identify open problems, 
questions that I'd personally like answered, but which don't yet seem to have been answered. I identify tricks,
observations that seem pregnant with possibility, but whose import I don't yet know. And, sometimes, I 
identify what seem to me to be field-wide blind spots. I add questions about all these to Anki as well. In 
this way, Anki is a medium supporting my creative research. It has some shortcomings as such a medium, since
it's not designed with supporting creative work in mind – it's not, for instance, equipped for lengthy, 
free-form exploration inside a scratch space. But even without being designed in such a way, it's helpful as
a creative support.

### Research mindset
([overview](#overview))

More by Carl Shulman from [the same document above](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_yuuheVqp1quDfkuRcpoW_HO7jPaI7QnRjF1zl_VovU/edit), this time on research mindset:

```markdown
Don't dismiss ideas as unthinkable (rather than actions as subject to strong injunctions): things that
people are afraid of thinking about (because it might make them look bad, might imply bad news, is 
unpopular) have an elevated chance of offering low-hanging fruit for thinking.

Have a strong emotional revulsion to self-delusion and sloppy reasoning/research, including people 
Wrong on the Internet within communities you have some affiliation with.

Listen to yourself if something seems troubling, and try articulating, exploring, and steel-manning 
that intuition in multiple ways until it makes sense in a way that can be integrated with other knowledge 
(with whatever updates/revisions follow) or goes away. Don't just run roughshod over 'system 1' feelings.

Being comfortable with your own personality, emotions, and desires can help with being willing to do that 
kind of analysis, by making fewer conclusions unacceptable to you (empirical ones in particular).

Rigid ideological systems in a lot of tension with your real goals can be a problem there. E.g. in
Mormonism or utilitarianism or social justice, various empirical conclusions combine with the ideology
to recommend ruining your life, and people are strongly conditioned to avoid them. 

Recognizing partial, as opposed to impartial, motives (personal projects, selfishness, family, tribalism) 
and not trying to rationalize everything with a 100% impartial facade, can help more comfortably think
about questions like average well-being, or the real trade-off between burnout and effort, etc.

### Distillation and research debt
([overview](#overview))

I keep coming back to Chris Olah and Shan Carter's essay [Research debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/), which in my eyes makes it an all-time great. The key terms are 'research debt', 'interpretive labor', and 'distillation'.

What is research debt? First, a parable:

```markdown
Achieving a research-level understanding of most topics is like climbing a mountain. Aspiring 
researchers must struggle to understand vast bodies of work that came before them, to learn 
techniques, and to gain intuition. Upon reaching the top, the new researcher begins doing novel
work, throwing new stones onto the top of the mountain and making it a little taller for whoever 
comes next.

Mathematics is a striking example of this. For centuries, countless minds have climbed the mountain 
range of mathematics and laid new boulders at the top. Over time, different peaks formed, built on
top of particularly beautiful results. Now the peaks of mathematics are so numerous and steep that
no person can climb them all. Even with a lifetime of dedicated effort, a mathematician may only
enjoy some of their vistas.

People expect the climb to be hard. It reflects the tremendous progress and cumulative effort that’s
gone into mathematics. The climb is seen as an intellectual pilgrimage, the labor a rite of passage.
But the climb could be massively easier. It’s entirely possible to build paths and staircases into 
these mountains. The climb isn’t something to be proud of.

The climb isn’t progress: the climb is a mountain of debt.
```

On to research debt, analogizing to programming and management:

```markdown
Programmers talk about technical debt: there are ways to write software that are faster in the short 
run but problematic in the long run. Managers talk about institutional debt: institutions can grow 
quickly at the cost of bad practices creeping in. Both are easy to accumulate but hard to get rid of.

Research can also have debt. It comes in several forms:

Poor Exposition – Often, there is no good explanation of important ideas and one has to struggle to
understand them. This problem is so pervasive that we take it for granted and don’t appreciate how 
much better things could be.
Undigested Ideas – Most ideas start off rough and hard to understand. They become radically easier
as we polish them, developing the right analogies, language, and ways of thinking.
Bad abstractions and notation – Abstractions and notation are the user interface of research, shaping
how we think and communicate. Unfortunately, we often get stuck with the first formalisms to develop
even when they’re bad. For example, an object with extra electrons is negative. 
Noise – Being a researcher is like standing in the middle of a construction site. Countless papers 
scream for your attention and there’s no easy way to filter or summarize them. 2 We think noise is 
the main way experts experience research debt.

The insidious thing about research debt is that it’s normal. Everyone takes it for granted, and 
doesn’t realize that things could be different. For example, it’s normal to give very mediocre 
explanations of research, and people perceive that to be the ceiling of explanation quality. On the
rare occasions that truly excellent explanations come along, people see them as one-off miracles
rather than a sign that we could systematically be doing better.
```

Research debt is the accumulation of missing interpretive labor:

```markdown
There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand
it. On one extreme, the explainer can painstakingly craft a beautiful explanation, leading their
audience to understanding without even realizing it could have been difficult. On the other extreme,
the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called
interpretive labor.

Many explanations are not one-to-one. People give lectures, write books, or communicate online. In these
one-to-many cases, each member of the audience pays the cost of understanding, even though the cost of 
explaining stays the same. 3 As a result, the cost of understanding has a multiplier in the interpretive
labor tradeoff — sometimes a huge multiplier.

In research, we often have a group of researchers all trying to understand each other. Just like before,
the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with 
each new member. At some size, the effort to understand everyone else becomes too much. As a defense 
mechanism, people specialize, focusing on a narrower area of interest. The maintainable size of the field
is controlled by how its members trade off the energy between communicating and understanding.

Research debt is the accumulation of missing interpretive labor. It’s extremely natural for young ideas to
go through a stage of debt, like early prototypes in engineering. The problem is that we often stop at that
point. Young ideas aren’t ending points for us to put in a paper and abandon. When we let things stop there
the debt piles up. It becomes harder to understand and build on each other’s work and the field fragments.
```

The importance of good 'user interfaces' for ideas:

```markdown
It’s worth being clear that research debt isn’t just about ideas not being explained well. It’s a lack 
of digesting ideas – or, at least, a lack of the public version of ideas being digested. It’s a communal
messiness of thought.

Developing good abstractions, notations, visualizations, and so forth, is improving the user interfaces
for ideas. This helps both with understanding ideas for the first time and with thinking clearly about 
them. Conversely, if we can’t explain an idea well, that’s often a sign that we don’t understand it as
well as we could.
```

A great real-world example of research debt killing a field is Bill Thurston and foliations. Here's his reminiscences in my favorite paper of his, [On proof and progress in mathematics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236v1.pdf):

```markdown
At that time, foliations had become a big center of attention among geometric 
topologists, dynamical systems people, and differential geometers. I fairly rapidly
proved some dramatic theorems. I proved a classification theorem for foliations,
giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a manifold to admit a foliation. I
proved a number of other significant theorems. I wrote respectable papers and
published at least the most important theorems. It was hard to find the time to
write to keep up with what I could prove, and I built up a backlog.

An interesting phenomenon occurred. Within a couple of years, a dramatic evacuation 
of the field started to take place. I heard from a number of mathematicians that they
were giving or receiving advice not to go into foliations—they were saying that Thurston
was cleaning it out. People told me (not as a complaint, but as a compliment) that I was
killing the field. Graduate students stopped studying foliations, and fairly soon, I turned
to other interests as well. ...

I do not think that the evacuation occurred because the territory was intellectually exhausted—
there were (and still are) many interesting questions that remain and that are probably 
approachable. ... I believe that two ecological effects were much more important in putting a
damper on the subject than any exhaustion of intellectual resources that occurred.

First, the results I proved (as well as some important results of other people)
were documented in a conventional, formidable mathematician’s style. They depended heavily on 
readers who shared certain background and certain insights. 
The theory of foliations was a young, opportunistic subfield, and the background
was not standardized. I did not hesitate to draw on any of the mathematics I
had learned from others. The papers I wrote did not (and could not) spend much
time explaining the background culture. They documented top-level reasoning and
conclusions that I often had achieved after much reflection and effort. I also threw
out prize cryptic tidbits of insight, such as “the Godbillon-Vey invariant measures
the helical wobble of a foliation”, that remained mysterious to most mathematicans
who read them. This created a high entry barrier: I think many graduate students
and mathematicians were discouraged that it was hard to learn and understand the
proofs of key theorems.
```

<a name="#erisology"></a>
## Erisology
([overview](#overview))

From John Nerst's [What is erisology?](https://everythingstudies.com/what-is-erisology/), the founding document of the discipline:

```markdown
“Disagreement” can mean many things, but this is what I have in mind: A lot of online discourse
is hostile and often needlessly adversarial (I trust no one needs to be convinced of this). 
Specifically, a lot of this disagreement is dysfunctional, by which I mean that it results from 
(or is exacerbated by) one or both of the parties, intentionally or unintentionally, misunderstanding
the other party’s position or the nature of their differences. ...

Erisology is the study of this dysfunction and, theoretically, the attempt to fix some of it by
making people more aware of how it happens and how it doesn’t always need to happen. 

...a lot of different research paradigms and philosophical frameworks are in play when people talk
about anything even remotely abstract and/or ambiguous. And behind disagreement on even the most
concrete things there is often one or several undissolved philosophical issues being discussed by 
proxy, and at the same time the discussion process itself is disturbed by all kinds of corrupting
psychological and social influences.

An erisology research program would try to integrate basic insights and models from all these fields.
It would involve describing and cataloging the kinds of issues that hide under the surface in
dysfunctional discourse and the processes that make us unaware of them, contributing to the problem.
Ultimately and hypothetically the goal would be to improve discourse by creating and spreading ideas
and mental tools that work to defuse unnecessary conflict before it occurs, as well as clarify
necessary conflict so we know what it’s really about.
```

Erisology would necessarily be cross-discplinary, which is music to my ears. A sample:

```markdown
The study of cognitive biases and how they affect our thinking, breaking it in particular predictable
ways.

Traditional philosophy and its discussion of the nature of categories, objects and properties; a 
staggering proportion of online verbal conflict concern, at its core, some variety of the question
of what category something belongs in. The pitfall here is that people act as though such questions
have true answers when in most cases they don’t – making it possible for two people to both be right
while contradicting each other.

Data analysis and its understanding of the relationships between models and data, clusters and 
categories, axes and properties. Statistical modeling and interpretation issues mirror a lot of the
problems that arise when people use their own particular experiences to build models of how the world
works (which later clash with those of others).

Cognitive and perceptual psychology, for insights in how we form concepts in the brain and how they
affect our perceptions and interpretations of what we see, giving rise to differences between people 
we have a tough time understanding because they are so fundamental to our mental function they slip 
out of awareness. Also useful is how attitudes and opinions are sometimes the downstream result of 
ultimately physiological differences in perception and emotion.

Personality psychology, for differences between people that may create hard-to-comprehend, subconscious 
divisions.

Poststructuralist theory and its conception of language as being inherently slippery and devoid of 
ultimate, definitive meaning. Our intuitive blindness to this causes us to misinterpret things other
people say without realizing it.

Rhetoric, the art of persuasion, is partly useful because it’s a practice more than a science and as
far as I know lack theory that grounds “what works and what doesn’t” in human psychology.

Anthropology and its examination of how many things we take for granted in our societies are non-obvious
and somewhat arbitrary.

Literary theory and its treatment of narratives, their interpretation and how they cannot be definitive
or claim absolute truth.

Epistemology, and how people take for granted different approaches to knowledge. I’m not talking so much
about explicit differences like “personal revelation vs. scientific study” but more underlying differences
like the balance between personal experience and statistics, empirical data vs. theoretical considerations.
These differences are sometimes discussed but are present as an important factor in way more contexts than
they are explicitly talked about.

Sociology and history and their theories of social construction, which are very useful when not overstated
and used as a political bludgeon. They also have valuable insights about how the design of technology and 
institutions shape behavior.

Evolutionary psychology and social instincts, especially those related to intra- and intergroup conflict 
like argumentation, rivalry, social status, identity and dehumanization. An important aspect here is also
recognizing that modern large-scale societies is an extremely unnatural social structure for humans and
this gives rise to all kinds of weird effects.

Computer science, specifically insights from attempts to create artificial intelligence and the
difficulties of modeling human concepts. Writing software also give you good habits, since it often makes
you understand that accurately modeling reality is way more complicated that you first thought.

Not the purview of any particular field, but understanding reductionism and its discontents are important
to a lot of erisology covering the often disappointing interactions between academic disciplines. 
Differing attitudes to reductionism vs. inherent semantics makes people find different kinds of explanations
satisfactory.

### Argumentative charity
([overview](#overview))

My go-to text for charity is Scott Alexander's [founding post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/12/youre-probably-wondering-why-ive-called-you-here-today/) for his blog SSC. Here's the part I liked, which is pretty much all of the 'transferable' part:

```markdown
Absurdity is the natural human tendency to dismiss anything you disagree with as so stupid it doesn’t
even deserve consideration. In fact, you are virtuous for not considering it, maybe even heroic! You’re
refusing to dignify the evil peddlers of bunkum by acknowledging them as legitimate debate partners.

Charity is the ability to override that response. To assume that if you don’t understand how someone
could possibly believe something as stupid as they do, that this is more likely a failure of understanding 
on your part than a failure of reason on theirs.
```

Charity should be thought of like [Chesterton's fence](#chestertons-fence).

Charity as default, because even when it's uncalled for or ostensibly unnecessary it can be advantageous:

```markdown
The most effective way to learn any subject is to try to figure out exactly why a wrong position is wrong. 
And sometimes even a complete disaster of a theory will have a few salvageable pearls of wisdom that can’t 
be found anywhere else. The rationalist forum Less Wrong teaches the idea of steelmanning, rebuilding a 
stupid position into the nearest intelligent position and then seeing what you can learn from it.
```

### Chesterton's fence
([overview](#overview))

From Scott Alexander's [founding post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/02/12/youre-probably-wondering-why-ive-called-you-here-today/):

```markdown
There are many things charity is not. Charity is not a fuzzy-headed caricature-pomo attempt to say no one 
can ever be sure they’re right or wrong about anything. Once you understand the reasons a belief is 
attractive to someone, you can go ahead and reject it as soundly as you want. Nor is it an obligation to
spend time researching every crazy belief that might come your way. Time is valuable, and the less of it
you waste on intellectual wild goose chases, the better.

It’s more like Chesterton’s Fence. G.K. Chesterton gave the example of a fence in the middle of nowhere. A
traveller comes across it, thinks “I can’t think of any reason to have a fence out here, it sure was dumb 
to build one” and so takes it down. She is then gored by an angry bull who was being kept on the other side
of the fence.

Chesterton’s point is that “I can’t think of any reason to have a fence out here” is the worst reason to 
remove a fence. Someone had a reason to put a fence up here, and if you can’t even imagine what it was, it
probably means there’s something you’re missing about the situation and that you’re meddling in things you
don’t understand. None of this precludes the traveller who knows that this was historically a cattle farming
area but is now abandoned – ie the traveller who understands what’s going on – from taking down the fence.

As with fences, so with arguments. If you have no clue how someone could believe something, and so you decide
it’s stupid, you are much like Chesterton’s traveler dismissing the fence (and philosophers, like travelers, 
are at high risk of stumbling across bull.)

The community forum *The Scholar's Stage* has a great post, [Tradition is Smarter Than You Are](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html), that gives a couple examples of tradition-as-Chesterton's-fence. It begins like so:

```markdown
Brain-power alone is not enough to explain why humans are such a successful species. Humans, he 
(evolutionary anthropologist-cum-cross cultural psychologist Joseph Henrich) argues, are not nearly
as intelligent as we think they are. Remove them from the culture and environment they have learned 
to operate in and they fail quickly. His favorite example of this are European explorers who die in
the middle of deserts, jungles, or arctic wastes even though thousands of generations of hunter-
gatherers were able to survive and thrive in these same environments. If human success was due to our
ability to problem solve, analyze, and rationally develop novel solutions to novel challenges, the 
explorers should have been fine. Their ghastly fates suggest that rationality may not be the key to
human survival.
```

The key is cultural evolution. An example via the cassava plant, or manioc, from Heinrich's book [*The Secret of Our Success*](https://amzn.to/2LuDcEh):

```markdown
In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties
for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for
example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping,
grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once
separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more
days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in
the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing. 

Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are 
difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have
a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of
view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever,
seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was
ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would
still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people
would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically 
boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. 
Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea,
stomach troubles, and vomiting). 

So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem
fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is
certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this
is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan
mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She 
might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that 
the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative 
procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with
a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier
protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years
or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning. 

Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier 
generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does
not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally
opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal
opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology. 

Wait. Maybe I’m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it’s actually rather easy to individually figure
out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning
of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the 
first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying
commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile 
or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations.
The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of
years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local 
preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low
levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven’t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places,
there’s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On 
the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, 
but these techniques are spreading only slowly.

The point here is that cultural evolution is often much smarter than we are. Operating over generations 
as individuals unconsciously attend to and learn from more successful, prestigious, and healthier members
of their communities, this evolutionary process generates cultural adaptations. Though these complex 
repertoires appear well designed to meet local challenges, they are not primarily the products of 
individuals applying causal models, rational thinking, or cost-benefit analyses. Often, most or all of
the people skilled in deploying such adaptive practices do not understand how or why they work, or even 
that they “do” anything at all. Such complex adaptations can emerge precisely because natural selection
has favored individuals who often place their faith in cultural inheritance—in the accumulated wisdom 
implicit in the practices and beliefs derived from their forbearers—over their own intuitions and 
personal experiences.
```

Another example from northern Canada, where Naskapi foragers hunt caribou:

```markdown
When hunting caribou, Naskapi foragers in Labrador, Canada, had to decide where to go. Common sense might
lead one to go where one had success before or to where friends or neighbors recently spotted caribou. 
However, this situation is like Matching Pennies in chapter 2. The caribou are mismatchers and the 
hunters are matchers. That is, hunters want to match the locations of caribou while caribou want to 
mismatch the hunters, to avoid being shot and eaten. If a hunter shows any bias to return to previous 
spots, where he or others have seen caribou, then the caribou can benefit (survive better) by avoiding
those locations (where they have previously seen humans). 

Thus, the best hunting strategy requires randomizing. Can cultural evolution compensate for our 
cognitive inadequacies? Traditionally, Naskapi hunters decided where to go to hunt using divination and 
believed that the shoulder bones of caribou could point the way to success. To start the ritual, the shoulder
blade was heated over hot coals in a way that caused patterns of cracks and burnt spots to form. This 
patterning was then read as a kind of map, which was held in a pre-specified orientation. The cracking 
patterns were (probably) essentially random from the point of view of hunting locations, since the outcomes 
depended on myriad details about the bone, fire, ambient temperature, and heating process. Thus, these 
divination rituals may have provided a crude randomizing device that helped hunters avoid their own
decision-making biases. The undergraduates in the Matching Pennies game could have used a randomizing 
device like divination, though the chimps seem fine without it.
```

There's a similar practice in Indonesia employed by the Kantus of Kalimantan, who use bird augury to select locations for their agricultural plots:

```markdown
The anthropologist Michael Dove argues that two factors will cause farmers to make plot placements
that are too risky. First, Kantu ecological models contain the Gambler’s Fallacy and lead them to 
expect that floods will be less likely to occur in a specific location after a big flood in that 
location (which is not true). 

Second, as with the MBAs’ investment allocations in chapter 4, Kantus pay attention to others’ 
success and copy the choices of successful households, meaning that if one of their neighbors has
a good yield in an area one year, many other people will want to plant there in the next year. 
Reducing the risks posed by these cognitive and decision-making biases, the Kantu rely on a system
of bird augury that effectively randomizes their choices for locating garden plots, which helps them
avoid catastrophic crop failures. The results of divination depend not only on seeing a particular
bird species in a particular location, but also on what type of call the bird makes (one type of call 
may be favorable, and another unfavorable). 

The patterning of bird augury supports the view that this is a cultural adaptation. The system seems 
to have evolved and spread throughout this region since the seventeenth century when rice cultivation
was introduced. This makes sense, since it is rice cultivation that is most positively influenced by
randomizing garden locations. It’s possible that, with the introduction of rice, a few farmers began
to use bird sightings as an indication of favorable garden sites. On average, over a lifetime, these
farmers would do better—be more successful—than farmers who relied on the Gambler’s Fallacy or on 
copying others’ immediate behavior. 

Whatever the process, within 400 years, the bird augury system had spread throughout the agricultural
populations of this Borneo region. Yet it remains conspicuously missing or underdeveloped among local
foraging groups and recent adopters of rice agriculture, as well as among populations in northern 
Borneo who rely on irrigation. So, bird augury has been systematically spreading in those regions
where it is most adaptive. This example makes a key point: not only do people often not understand
what their cultural practices are doing, but sometimes it may even be important that they don’t
understand what their practices are doing or how they work. If people came to understand that bird 
augury or bone divination didn’t actually predict the future, the practice would probably be dropped
or people would increasingly ignore ritual findings in favor of their own intuitions.
```

There are two arguments Heinrich is making here:

```markdown
The first is that customs, traditions, and the like are subject to Darwinian selection. Henrich is not
always clear on exactly what is being selected for—is it individuals who follow a tradition, groups 
whose members all follow the tradition, or the tradition itself?—but the general gist is that traditions
stick around longest when they are adaptive. 

This process is "blind." Those who follow the traditions do not know how they work, and in some cases
(like religious rituals that build social solidarity) knowing the details of how they work might actually
reduce the efficacy of the tradition. That is the second argument of note: we do not (and often cannot)
understand just how the traditions we inherit help our survival, and because of that, it is difficult to
artificially create replacements. 
```

This, of course, jives perfectly with the work of James C. Scott. Here's *The Scholar's* summary intro:

```markdown
Scott has spent a large amount of his career studying the way states shape the societies they rule over, 
and the way societies try to resist the advance of the state. The central problem of ruler-ship, as Scott
sees it, is what he calls *legibility*. To extract resources from a population the state must be able to
understand that population. The state needs to make the people and things it rules legible to agents of
the government. Legibility means uniformity. States dream up uniform weights and measures, impress national
languages and ID numbers on their people, and divvy the country up into land plots and administrative 
districts, all to make the realm legible to the powers that be. 

The problem is that not all important things can be made legible. Much of what makes a society successful
is knowledge of the tacit sort: rarely articulated, messy, and from the outside looking in, purposeless. 
These are the first things lost in the quest for legibility. Traditions, small cultural differences, odd 
and distinctive lifeways—in other words, the products of cultural evolution that Henrich fills his book 
with—are all swept aside by a rationalizing state that preserves (or in many cases, imposes) only what it 
can be understood and manipulated from the 2,000 foot view. The result, as Scott chronicles with example
after example, are many of the greatest catastrophes of human history.

### Absurdity heuristic
([overview](#overview))

From Scott Alexander's [Talking Snakes: A Cautionary Tale](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/atcJqdhCxTZiJSxo2/talking-snakes-a-cautionary-tale):

```markdown
I have read of the absurdity heuristic. I know that it is not carte blanche to go around rejecting
beliefs that seem silly. But I was still sympathetic to (Bill Maher's) talking snake argument. After
all... *a talking snake?*

I changed my mind in a Cairo cafe, talking to a young Muslim woman. I let it slip during the
conversation that I was an atheist, and she seemed genuinely curious why. You've all probably been in
such a situation, and you probably know how hard it is to choose just one reason, but I'd been 
reading about Biblical contradictions at the time and I mentioned the myriad errors and atrocities 
and contradictions in all the Holy Books.

Her response? "Oh, thank goodness it's that. I was afraid you were one of those crazies who believed
that monkeys transformed into humans."

I admitted that um, well, maybe I sorta kinda might in fact believe that.

It is hard for me to describe exactly the look of shock on her face, but I have no doubt that her
horror was genuine. I may have been the first flesh-and-blood evolutionist she ever met. "But..." she
looked at me as if I was an idiot. "Monkeys don't change into humans. What on Earth makes you think 
monkeys can change into humans?"

I admitted that the whole process was rather complicated. I suggested that it wasn't exactly a
Optimus Prime-style transformation so much as a gradual change over eons and eons. I recommended a few 
books on evolution that might explain it better than I could.

She said that she respected me as a person but that quite frankly I could save my breath because there 
was no way any book could possibly convince her that monkeys have human babies or whatever sort of
balderdash I was preaching. She accused me and other evolution believers of being too willing to accept
absurdities, motivated by our atheism and our fear of the self-esteem hit we'd take by accepting Allah
was greater than ourselves.

It is not clear to me that this woman did anything differently than Bill Maher. Both heard statements 
that sounded so crazy as to not even merit further argument. Both recognized that there was a large
group of people who found these statements plausible and had written extensive literature justifying
them. Both decided that the statements were so absurd as to not merit examining that literature more
closely. Both came up with reasons why they could discount the large number of believers because
those believers must be biased.

I post this as a cautionary tale as we discuss the logic or illogic of theism. I propose taking from 
it the following lessons:

- The absurdity heuristic doesn't work very well.

- Even on things that sound really, really absurd.

- If a large number of intelligent people believe something, it deserves your attention. After you've 
studied it on its own terms, then you have a right to reject it. You could still be wrong, though.

- Even if you can think of a good reason why people might be biased towards the silly idea, thus
explaining it away, your good reason may still be false.

- If someone cannot explain why something is not stupid to you over twenty minutes at a cafe, that
doesn't mean it's stupid. It just means it's complicated, or they're not very good at explaining things.

- There is no royal road.
```

Additional commentary by Eliezer Yudkowsky:

```markdown
Consider: If all the *rest* of the religious framework were granted, would the talking snake be an 
*additional problem*? No. The talking snake is only absurd if you refuse to grant the rest of the 
religious framework. The fact that a snake is talking is not, of itself, the source of any *additional*
problem - unless you were to argue that it fits the mode of a classic bias like minimal 
counterintuitiveness or thinking that "talking" is a simple feature that can easily be grafted on, etc.
But the point is, the part where a talking snake is in this story, is, presuming the story's other 
premises, not the proper subject of the dispute.

The problem is the other premises, and notions like sin passed down through generations, or that the 
sin was contained in an easily accessible tree put right there in the Garden (trap much?), or the fact
that a supernatural God is in the story - and so on and so on.

When you look at it from that perspective, then indeed, saying "Ha ha, a talking snake" is the exact
mirror image of saying "Ha ha, a monkey birthed a human", because it takes refuge in absurdity instead
of addressing the most important part of an argument as a whole.

The contradictions are a proper point of attack, but only if they would be really, genuinely troublesome 
*even granting the rest of the premises*.
```

Zaph:

```markdown
The use of absurdity seems more like a tool to enforce group norms than a means of conversion. That 
doesn't mean the beliefs aren't absurd, just that pointing out the absurdity of outsiders is common 
practice by in-group members. Most creationist-minded believers would use some similarly absurd way
of describing evolution, with the group benefit of passing along "evolution is stupid" meme. That said,
it is important to start to tease apart just how many other enforcement strategies are out there, as
they are going to need to be dealt with one by one.

<a name="#typical-mind-fallacy"></a>
### Typical mind fallacy
([overview](#overview))

Scott Alexander's LW post [Generalizing From One Example](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/baTWMegR42PAsH9qJ/generalizing-from-one-example) begins with the following example of the "typical mind fallacy" by his old professor David Berman, about whether "imagination" was real or just a turn of phrase:

```markdown
There was a debate, in the late 1800s, about whether "imagination" was simply a turn of phrase or 
a real phenomenon. That is, can people actually create images in their minds which they see vividly,
or do they simply say "I saw it in my mind" as a metaphor for considering what it looked like?

Upon hearing this, my response was "How the stars was this actually a real debate? Of course we have
mental imagery. Anyone who doesn't think we have mental imagery is either such a fanatical Behaviorist 
that she doubts the evidence of her own senses, or simply insane." Unfortunately, the professor was 
able to parade a long list of famous people who denied mental imagery, including some leading scientists
of the era. And this was all before Behaviorism even existed.

The debate was resolved by Francis Galton, a fascinating man who among other achievements invented 
eugenics, the "wisdom of crowds", and standard deviation. Galton gave people some very detailed surveys,
and found that some people did have mental imagery and others didn't. The ones who did had simply 
assumed everyone did, and the ones who didn't had simply assumed everyone didn't, to the point of coming 
up with absurd justifications for why they were lying or misunderstanding the question. There was a wide
spectrum of imaging ability, from about five percent of people with perfect eidetic imagery to three
percent of people completely unable to form mental images.

Dr. Berman dubbed this the Typical Mind Fallacy: the human tendency to believe that one's own mental 
structure can be generalized to apply to everyone else's.

He kind of took this idea and ran with it. He interpreted certain passages in George Berkeley's biography
to mean that Berkeley was an eidetic imager, and that this was why the idea of the universe as sense-
perception held such interest to him. He also suggested that experience of consciousness and qualia were 
as variable as imaging, and that philosophers who deny their existence (Ryle? Dennett? Behaviorists?) were
simply people whose mind lacked the ability to easily experience qualia. In general, he believed philosophy
of mind was littered with examples of philosophers taking their own mental experiences and building theories
on them, and other philosophers with different mental experiences critiquing them and wondering why they
disagreed.
```

Now this is "about serious matters of mental structure". Scott noticed something similar going on with "matters of the psyche" -- a tendency to generalize from our personalities and behaviors. He gives two personal examples, introversion and noise sensitivity:

```markdown
For example, I'm about as introverted a person as you're ever likely to meet - anyone more introverted 
than I am doesn't communicate with anyone. All through elementary and middle school, I suspected that 
the other children were out to get me. They kept on grabbing me when I was busy with something and trying
to drag me off to do some rough activity with them and their friends. When I protested, they counter-
protested and told me I really needed to stop whatever I was doing and come join them. I figured they 
were bullies who were trying to annoy me, and found ways to hide from them and scare them off.

Eventually I realized that it was a double misunderstanding. They figured I must be like them, and the 
only thing keeping me from playing their fun games was that I was too shy. I figured they must be like me,
and that the only reason they would interrupt a person who was obviously busy reading was that they wanted
to annoy him.

Likewise: I can't deal with noise. If someone's being loud, I can't sleep, I can't study, I can't 
concentrate, I can't do anything except bang my head against the wall and hope they stop. I once had a noisy
housemate. Whenever I asked her to keep it down, she told me I was being oversensitive and should just
mellow out. I can't claim total victory here, because she was very neat and kept yelling at me for leaving
things out of place, and I told her she needed to just mellow out and you couldn't even tell that there was
dust on that dresser anyway. It didn't occur to me then that neatness to her might be as necessary and
uncompromisable as quiet was to me, and that this was an actual feature of how our minds processed information
rather than just some weird quirk on her part.

"Just some weird quirk on her part" and "just being oversensitive" are representative of the problem with the
typical psyche fallacy, which is that it's invisible. We tend to neglect the role of differently-built minds
in disagreements, and attribute the problems to the other side being deliberately perverse or confused. I 
happen to know that loud noise seriously pains and debilitates me, but when I say this to other people they
think I'm just expressing some weird personal preference for quiet. Think about all those poor non-imagers 
who thought everyone else was just taking a metaphor about seeing mental images way too far and refusing to 
give it up.
```

An example from Scott's experience with teaching -- see also [here](#teaching-and-learning):

```markdown
There's some evidence that the usual method of interacting with people involves something sorta like 
emulating them within our own brain. We think about how we would react, adjust for the other person's
differences, and then assume the other person would react that way. This method of interaction is very 
tempting, and it always feels like it ought to work.

But when statistics tell you that the method that would work on you doesn't work on anyone else, then
continuing to follow that gut feeling is a Typical Psyche Fallacy. You've got to be a good rationalist,
reject your gut feeling, and follow the data.

I only really discovered this in my last job as a school teacher. There's a lot of data on teaching 
methods that students enjoy and learn from. I had some of these methods...inflicted...on me during my 
school days, and I had no intention of abusing my own students in the same way. And when I tried the
sorts of really creative stuff I would have loved as a student...it fell completely flat. What ended up 
working? Something pretty close to the teaching methods I'd hated as a kid. Oh. Well. Now I know why 
people use them so much. And here I'd gone through life thinking my teachers were just inexplicably bad 
at what they did, never figuring out that I was just the odd outlier who couldn't be reached by this sort
of stuff.
```

Scott elaborates:

```markdown
Keeping in mind that I taught English as a second language to older elementary school children:

Ordinary teaching methods: constant repetition of unconnected topics followed by endless vapid games.
For example, a game of bingo with vocabulary words in each square. Attempts to trick children into 
thinking something was interesting; for example, calling vocabulary "word baseball" or something like that
and dressing up in a baseball cap while teaching it.

Things I predicted would work better: attempts to make material genuinely interesting, have each lesson 
build on the previous, and create links between different concepts. For example, a lesson on the days of
the week including a mini-presentation on the Norse gods after whom they were named, references to previous 
lessons when we had learned "sun" and "moon" for Sunday and Monday. Attempt to teach how to apply general 
principles instead of doing everything ad hoc.
```

Note that this all goes against the University of Missouri's [25 important findings on learning](#important-findings-on-learning), which is basically just an executive summary of the literature plus action items (themselves shortened rephrasings of the executive summaries), and yet they agree with Quoran teacher Matthew Bates' experience (see [his answers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Matthew-Bates-27)) so in the end I don't know. Maybe the former are talking about students from lower SES families (correlating with lower educational achievement)?

Dan Dennett gives an interesting illustration/test of mental imagery:

```markdown
Picture a 3 by 3 grid. Then picture the words "gas", "oil", and "dry" spelled downwards in the columns 
left to right in that order. Looking at the picture in your mind, read the words across on the grid.
```

Scientism points out a version of the typical mind fallacy in how people "vastly overestimate their own goodness" when it comes to "testimony on one's moral worth":

```markdown
Often "goodness" is just a way to dress up powerlessness. Like an overweight man might say he's "stocky" 
or an overweight woman might say she's "curvy," so an undesirable or shy man or woman might emphasize the 
upside: "I would never cheat." There's a version of the typical mind fallacy in there: a person might 
genuinely think they would never cheat but be extrapolating from a position where the opportunity rarely 
presents itself. We can all talk about how, if we were in a position of political power, we'd never succumb
to bribes or cronyism because we don't have any political power. It both makes us look good and, as far as 
we know, it's true. I think testimony, especially when it comes to ones moral worth, is the least valuable 
form of data available.
```

This segues naturall to the Milgram experiment, the Stanford prison experiment, and the case of Nazi-era German civilians:

```markdown
When I've taught ethics in the past, we always discuss the Nazi era. Not because the Nazis acted
unethically, but because of how everyone else acted.

For example, we read about the vans that carried Jewish prisoners that had the exhaust system designed
to empty into the van. The point is not how awful that is, but that there must have been an engineer 
somewhere who figured out the best way to design and build such a thing. And that engineer wasn't a Nazi
soldier, he or she was probably no different from anyone else at that time, with kids and a family and
friends and so on. Not an evil scientist in a lab, but just a design engineer in a corporation.

One point of the discussion is that "normal" people have acted quite unethically in the past, and how can
we prevent that happening to us.
```

From mental imagery to aural imagination, and their trainability, per cousin_it:

```markdown
Only this winter did I really understand that good musicians have vivid aural imagination, while I 
couldn't hear any sounds in my head, period. Immediately after this realization I started exercising. 
By now I can hear complete monophonic melodies, and (on good days) imagine two notes sounding at the 
same time. Classically trained conductors can imagine a complete orchestral sound while reading sheet
music. I don't see any reason why visual imagination can't be similarly trained.
```

How cousin_it trained the skill:

```markdown
The hardest part for me was the beginning, getting a toehold at any inner sound. Pick a note on 
the guitar - I started with D on the second string. Play it at a steady rhythm with rests, slowly
fading away into nothing. (Might not be possible on the piano or other instruments.) At some moment
the brain will start to "complete" the sound, even though by that point you're playing too softly to
hear. Catch that feeling, expand on it. When you can "do" several different notes, try playing a 
simple melody and hearing it afterwards. After you're comfortable with that, try to hear a simple major
scale without playing it immediately beforehand. Then work from unfamiliar sheet music without playing it
- solfege-sing in your mind - by now I can do this quite easily. And so on.
```

Prismattic points out how this plays out in books vs movies preferences:

```markdown
It struck me that I think you can still see the imagination debate playing out today. Consider the 
following conversation, which most people will have encountered a variant of at least once+:

-- Mr. Highbrow: It is better to read books than watch movies based on them. The movies limit you to 
someone else's perspective on the material, but the book gives maximum reign to your imagination.

-- Mr. Lowbrow: What are you smoking? The movie is an immersive experience that makes me feel like I'm 
really in the story. The book is just somebody else's description of the story.

Having thought about it, my highest-probability hypothesis is now that Mr. HB has more vivid mental 
imagery than does Mr. LB. Further introspection led me to realize that when I read fiction, I often have
very specific images of places and scenery, but usually only vague impressions of faces. When I watch 
film adaptions, I'm often struck that the setting is "wrong," but rarely have that feeling about the 
appearance of people (unless the actors are grossly divergent from the description of them in the book)

## Errors vs bugs
([overview](#overview))

Sarah Constantin is one of my favorite writers. She has a blog, [Otium](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/), and goes by 
celandine13 on LiveJournal. This quote on the _error vs bug model of learning_ comes from her LJ essay 
[Errors vs Bugs and the End of Stupidity](https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html).

```markdown
A common mental model for performance is what I'll call the "error model."  In the error model, a person's 
performance of a musical piece (or performance on a test) is a perfect performance plus some random error.  
You can literally think of each note, or each answer, as x + c times epsilon_i, where x is the correct note 
/ answer, and epsilon_i is a random variable, iid Gaussian or something.  Better performers have a lower 
error rate c.  Improvement is a matter of lowering your error rate.  This, or something like it, is the model 
that underlies school grades and test scores. Your grade is based on the percent you get correct.  Your 
performance is defined by a single continuous parameter, your accuracy.

But we could also consider the "bug model" of errors.  A person taking a test or playing a piece of music is 
executing a program, a deterministic procedure.  If your program has a bug, then you'll get a whole class of 
problems wrong, consistently.  Bugs, unlike error rates, can't be quantified along a single axis as less or 
more severe.  A bug gets everything that it affects wrong.  And fixing bugs doesn't improve your performance 
in a continuous fashion; you can fix a "little" bug and immediately go from getting everything wrong to 
everything right.  You can't really describe the accuracy of a buggy program by the percent of questions it 
gets right; if you ask it to do something different, it could suddenly go from 99% right to 0% right.  You 
can only define its behavior by isolating what the bug does.

Often, I think mistakes are more like bugs than errors.  My clinkers weren't random; they were in specific 
places, because I had sub-optimal fingerings in those places.  A kid who gets arithmetic questions wrong 
usually isn't getting them wrong at random; there's something missing in their understanding, like not 
getting the difference between multiplication and addition.  Working generically "harder" doesn't fix bugs 
(though fixing bugs does require work). 

Once you start to think of mistakes as deterministic rather than random, as caused by "bugs" (incorrect 
understanding or incorrect procedures) rather than random inaccuracy, a curious thing happens.

You stop thinking of people as "stupid."

Tags like "stupid," "bad at X", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying "You're performing badly and I 
don't know why." Once you move it to "you're performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or 
"you're performing badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague personal 
failing but a causal necessity. Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. 

It's not you, it's the bug.

### Important findings on learning
([overview](#overview))

From the University of Missouri's [25 Learning Principles to Guide Pedagogy and the
Design of Learning Environments](http://whaaales.com/25principlesoflearning.pdf). I only picked those I found interesting. 

Contiguity Effects:

```markdown
Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time in the
multimedia learning environment. For example, the verbal label for a picture needs to be placed
spatially near the picture on the display, not on the other side of the screen. An explanation of an
event should be given when the event is depicted rather than many minutes, hours, or days later.
```

Perceptual-motor Grounding:

```markdown
Whenever a concept is first introduced, it is important to ground it in a concrete
perceptual-motor experience. The learner will ideally visualize a picture of the concept, will be
able to manipulate its parts and aspects, and will observe how it functions over time. The teacher
and learner will also gain a common ground (shared knowledge) of the learning material.

Perceptual-motor experience is particularly important when there is a need for precision, such as
getting directions to find a spatial location. For example, a course in statistics is not grounded in
perceptual-motor experience when the teacher presents symbols and formulae that have no
meaning to the student and cannot be visualized
```

Dual Code and Multimedia Effects:

```markdown
Information is encoded and remembered better when it is delivered in multiple modes
(verbal and pictorial), sensory modalities (auditory and visual), or media (computers and
lectures) than when delivered in only a singe mode, modality, or medium. Dual codes provide
richer and more varied representations that allow more memory retrieval routes. 

However, the amount of information should not overwhelm the learner because attention is 
split or cognitive capacities are overloaded.
```

Testing Effect:

```markdown
There are direct and indirect effects of taking frequent tests. One indirect benefit is that
frequent testing keeps students constantly engaged in the material. Although students will learn
from testing without receiving feedback, there is less forgetting if students receive informative
feedback about their performance. Multiple tests slow forgetting better than a single test.
Formative assessment refers to the use of testing results to guide teachers in making decisions
about what to teach. Learners also benefit if they use test results as a guide for their own
learning. 
```

The best way to do this is via spaced repetition. It's the whole idea behind Anki flashcards. See also [here](#augmenting-long-term-memory), as well as the next section -- Spaced Effects:

```markdown
Spaced schedules of testing (like spaced schedules of studying) produce better long-term
retention than a single test. When a single test is administered immediately after learning,
students obtain high scores, but long-term retention is reduced with a single immediate test
relative to spaced testing. When a test is given immediately after learning has occurred, learners
still have the newly-learned information in a primary memory system and therefore obtain high
test scores. Both teachers and learners often misjudge their high scores on a test given
immediately after learning as evidence of good retention, when, in fact, long-term retention
suffers with this practice
```

Generation Effect:

```markdown
Learning is enhanced when learners produce answers compared to having them recognize
answers. Free recall or essay tests which require the test taker to generate answers with minimal
cues produce better learning than multiple choice tests in which the learner only needs to be able
to recognize correct answers. In fact, free recall tests produce as much learning as restudying the
material
```

Organization effects (part of the reason this document exists in the first place!):

```markdown
Outlining, integrating, and synthesizing information produces better learning than rereading
materials or other more passive strategies. Students frequently report that when they study they
reread materials they already read once. Strategies that require learners to be actively engaged
with the material to-be-learned produce better long-term retention than the passive act of reading.
Learners should develop their own mini-testing situations as they review, such as stating the
information in their own words (without viewing the text) and synthesizing information from
multiple sources, such as from class and textbooks.
```

Coherence effect (Robert Frost does this well in [his answers on Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Frost-1/answers)):

```markdown
The learner needs to get a coherent, well connected representation of the main ideas to be
learned. It is important to remove distracting, irrelevant material, even when the added
information is artistically appealing. Seductive details that do not address the main points to be
conveyed run the risk of consuming the learner’s attention and effort at the expense of their
missing the main points. 
```

Stories and example cases (see also [John Baez on why math publications should take a page from the storytelling skillbook](#why-math-is-boring)):

```markdown
Stories and other forms of narrative are easier to read, comprehend, and remember than
other types of learning materials. For many millennia, the primary way of passing wisdom down
from generation to generation was through stories. Stories have concrete characters, objects,
locations, plot, themes, emotions, and actions that bear some similarity to everyday experiences.
Many stories also convey a point or moral that can be generalized to many situations. Example
cases in a story-like format are persuasive, easy to comprehend, and very memorable. 
```

Negative suggestion effects:

```markdown
Just as people learn correct information with frequent testing, they also can learn wrong
information this way. For example, when incorrect alternatives on multiple choice tests are
presented, the wrong answers can be learned instead of the correct answers. This effect is also
found on short answer essay questions when students do not know the answers and use their
general knowledge about the field to construct a response that seems reasonable to them. In this
situation, learners recall their incorrect, but logically consistent response as being correct. These
effects can be reduced when learners receive feedback immediately after taking a test which
allows them to revise their memory and understanding without delay.
```

Desirable Difficulties (struggle promotes long-term recall -- true more so in math):
 
```markdown
Learning is enhanced when learners have to organize the information themselves or exert
additional effort during acquisition or retrieval than in conditions in which the information to be
learned or retrieved does not require effort. One possible explanation for this effect is that
learners create multiple retrieval paths which make the information more accessible at retrieval.
These practices slow initial learning, but promote long-term recall.
```

Explanation effects:

```markdown
Explanations consist of causal analyses of events, logical justifications of claims, and
functional rationales for actions. Explanations provide coherence to the material and justify why
information is relevant and important. Students may be prompted to give self-explanations of the
material through think aloud protocols or questioning tasks that elicit explanations that connect
the material to what they already know. Self-explanations and the activity of studying good
explanations facilitate deeper comprehension, learning, memory, and transfer. 
```

Deep questions:

```markdown
Deep explanations of material and reasoning are elicited by questions such as why, how,
what-if-and what-if not, as opposed to shallow questions that require the learner to simply fill in
missing words, such as who, what, where, and when. Training students to ask deep questions
facilitates comprehension of material from text and classroom lectures. The learner gets into the
mindset of having deeper standards of comprehension and the resulting representations are more
elaborate. 
```

Cognitive disequilibrium:

```markdown
Cognitive disequilibrium stimulates inquiry, curiosity, thinking, and deep questions,
which in turn lead to deeper learning. Cognitive disequilibrium occurs when there are obstacles
to goals, contradictions, conflicts, anomalous events, breakdown scenarios, salient gaps in
knowledge, uncertainty, equally attractive alternatives, and other types of impasses. When these
impasses occur, the learner needs to engage in reasoning, thought, problem solving, and planning
in route to restoring cognitive equilibrium. There is a higher incidence of deep questions,
thought, reasoning, and study efforts when learners undergo cognitive disequilibrium.
```

Goldilocks principle: 

```markdown
Assignments should not be too hard or two easy, but at the right level of difficulty for the
student’s level of skill or prior knowledge. The definition of the zone of proximal development
(ZPD) is a bit more technical: the difference in learning that occurs with versus without a
learning scaffold (e.g., tutor, teacher, text, and computer). Researchers have identified a number
of zones that reflect how much learning, memory, mastery, or satisfaction occurs along a
continuum of task difficulty and that is sensitive to individual differences among learners. When
the material is too easy for the learner, the student is not challenged and may get bored. When it
is too difficult, the student acquires very little and gets frustrated or tunes out
```

Anchored learning:

```markdown
Anchored learning occurs when students work in teams for several hours or days trying to
solve a challenging practical problem that matters to the student. The activity is linked to
background knowledge of the learner on a topic that is interesting. The problem is challenging,
so the learner needs to engage in problem solving and recruit multiple levels of knowledge and
skills. These activities are coherently organized around solving the practical problem. Examples
of anchored learning are problem-based curricula in medical schools where students work on
genuine medical cases and communities of practice where students try to solve problems of
pollution in their city.

### Polymathy
([overview](#overview))

Here's Eric Drexler on [how to understand everything](http://metamodern.com/2009/05/17/how-to-understand-everything-and-why/) and [how to learn about everything](http://metamodern.com/2009/05/27/how-to-learn-about-everything/).

I feel a sort of kinship with what people like Drexler are trying to do here, albeit for different reasons. To oversimplify by mapping my motivations in doing the same to the ‘carrot-and-stick’ model: my carrot is this intrinsic need to ‘see the Systems of the World’ (paraphrasing Neal Stephenson, evoking the unnamed protagonist in Ted Chiang’s Understand, etc); my stick is the pain of being blindsided by unknown unknowns (so I have to at least know the outlines of everything, if not their contents, and how they all fit together). A deeper understanding than the “teacher’s password” awareness of trivia competition champions and my high school self, but not much deeper, not so deep as to sacrifice breadth.

But I digress. Eric contends that we need "knowledge of extent and structure of human knowledge on a trans-disciplinary scale":

```markdown
Formal education in science and engineering centers on teaching facts and problem-solving skills in a 
series of narrow topics. It is true that a few topics, although narrow in content, have such broad 
application that they are themselves integrative: These include (at a bare minimum) substantial chunks 
of mathematics and the basics of classical mechanics and electromagnetism, with the basics of 
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics close behind.

Most subjects in science and engineering, however, are narrower than these, and advanced education 
means deeper and narrower education. What this kind of education omits is knowledge of extent and 
structure of human knowledge on a trans-disciplinary scale. This means understanding — in a particular,
limited sense — everything.
```

How to figure out the outlines of a field, and knowledge about knowledge:

```markdown
To avoid blunders and absurdities, to recognize cross-disciplinary opportunities, and to make sense of
new ideas, requires knowledge of at least the outlines of every field that might be relevant to the 
topics of interest. By knowing the outlines of a field, I mean knowing the answers, to some reasonable
approximation, to questions like these:

What are the physical phenomena?
What causes them?
What are their magnitudes?
When might they be important?
How well are they understood?
How well can they be modeled?
What do they make possible?
What do they forbid?

And even more fundamental than these are questions of knowledge about knowledge:

What is known today?
What are the gaps in what I know?
When would I need to know more to solve a problem?
How could I find what I need?

This sort of knowledge is a kind of specialty, really — a limited slice of learning, but oriented
crosswise. Because of this orientation, though, it provides leverage in integrating knowledge from
diverse sources.
```

Why care? Problem recognition is very important:

```markdown
It takes far less knowledge to recognize a problem than to solve it, yet in key respects, that bit 
of knowledge is more important: With recognition, a problem may be avoided, or solved, or an idea 
abandoned. Without recognition, a hidden problem may invalidate the labor of an hour, or a lifetime.
Lack of a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.
```

Eric distinguishes between learning everything (which is impossible) and learning *about* everything (which is not):

```markdown
Note that the title above isn’t “how to learn everything”, but “how to learn about everything”. The 
distinction I have in mind is between knowing the inside of a topic in deep detail — many facts and 
problem-solving skills — and knowing the structure and context of a topic: essential facts, what 
problems can be solved by the skilled, and how the topic fits with others.

This knowledge isn’t superficial in a survey-course sense: It is about both deep structure and practical
applications. Knowing about, in this sense, is crucial to understanding a new problem and what must be 
learned in more depth in order to solve it. The cross-disciplinary reach of nanotechnology almost
demands this as a condition of competence.
```

Some advice on going about it:

```markdown
To intellectually ambitious students I recommend investing a lot of time in a mode of study that may 
feel wrong. An implicit lesson of classroom education is that successful study leads to good test 
scores, but this pattern of study is radically different. It cultivates understanding of a kind that 
won’t help pass tests — the classroom kind, that is:

Read and skim journals and textbooks that (at the moment) you only half understand. Include Science 
and Nature.

Don’t halt, dig a hole, and study a particular subject as if you had to pass a test on it.

Don’t avoid a subject because it seems beyond you — instead, read other half-understandable journals 
and textbooks to absorb more vocabulary, perspective, and context, then circle back.

Notice that concepts make more sense when you revisit a topic.

Notice which topics link in all directions, and provide keys to many others. Consider taking a class.

Continue until almost everything you encounter in Science and Nature makes sense as a contribution to 
a field you know something about.

## Psychology
([overview](#overview))

Keith E. Stanovich, [How to Think Straight About Psychology](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205914128.pdf):

```markdown
Often a person uses some folk proverb to explain a behavioral event even though, on an earlier occasion, this 
same person used a directly contradictory folk proverb to explain the same type of event. For example, most of 
us have heard or said, “look before you leap.” Now there’s a useful, straightforward bit of behavioral advice—
except that I vaguely remember admonishing on occasion, “he who hesitates is lost.” And “absence makes the heart 
grow fonder” is a pretty clear prediction of an emotional reaction to environmental events. But then what about 
“out of sight, out of mind”? And if “haste makes waste,” why do we sometimes hear that “time waits for no man”? 
How could the saying “two heads are better than one” not be true? Except that “too many cooks spoil the broth.” 
If I think “it’s better to be safe than sorry,” why do I also believe “nothing ventured, nothing gained”? And if 
“opposites attract,” why do “birds of a feather flock together”? I have counseled many students to “never to put 
off until tomorrow what you can do today.” But I hope my last advisee has never heard me say this, because I just 
told him, “cross that bridge when you come to it.”

The enormous appeal of clichés like these is that, taken together as implicit “explanations” of behavior, they 
cannot be refuted. No matter what happens, one of these explanations will be cited to cover it. No wonder we all 
think we are such excellent judges of human behavior and personality. We have an explanation for anything and 
everything that happens. Folk wisdom is cowardly in the sense that it takes no risk that it might be refuted.

That folk wisdom is “after the fact” wisdom, and that it actually is useless in a truly predictive sense, is why 
sociologist Duncan Watts titled one of his books: Everything Is Obvious—Once You Know the Answer (2011). Watts 
discusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in which, over 60 years ago, he was dealing with the common 
criticism that “social science doesn’t tell us anything that we don’t already know.” Lazarsfeld listed a series 
of findings from a massive survey of 600,000 soldiers who had served during World War II; for example, that men 
from rural backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of service than soldiers from city backgrounds. 
People tend to find all of the survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for instance, people tend 
to think it obvious that rural men would have been used to harsher physical conditions and thus would have 
adapted better to the conditions of military life. It is likewise with all of the other findings—people find them 
pretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then reveals his punchline: All of the findings were the opposite of what was originally 
stated. For example, it was actually the case that men from city backgrounds were in better spirits during their 
time of service than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last part of the learning exercise is for people to 
realize how easily they would have explained just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual outcome, people 
tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying that they expected it because city men are used to working 
in crowded conditions and under hierarchical authority. They never realize how easily they would have concocted an 
explanation for exactly the opposite finding.

### General philosophy
([overview](#overview))

Scott Aaronson, in response to Luke Muehlhauser's interview question "why be interested in philosophy?" in the [MIRI Conversations series](https://intelligence.org/2013/12/13/aaronson/):

```markdown
I’ve always been reflexively drawn to the biggest, most general questions that it seemed possible to 
ask. You know, like are we living in a computer simulation? if not, could we upload our consciousnesses
into one? are there discrete “pixels” of spacetime? why does it seem impossible to change the past? 
could there be different laws of physics where 2+2 equaled 5? are there objective facts about morality?
what does it mean to be rational? is there an explanation for why I’m alive right now, rather than some
other time? What are explanations, anyway? In fact, what really perplexes me is when I meet a smart, 
inquisitive person—let’s say a mathematician or scientist—who claims NOT to be obsessed with these huge
issues! I suspect many MIRI readers might feel drawn to such questions the same way I am, in which case
there’s no need to belabor the point.

From my perspective, then, the best way to frame the question is not: “why be interested in philosophy?” 
Rather it’s: “why be interested in anything else?”

But I think the latter question has an excellent answer. A crucial thing humans learned, starting around 
Galileo’s time, is that even if you’re interested in the biggest questions, usually the only way to make
progress on them is to pick off smaller subquestions: ideally, subquestions that you can attack using 
math, empirical observation, or both. For again and again, you find that the subquestions aren’t nearly
as small as they originally looked! Much like with zooming in to the Mandelbrot set, each subquestion has 
its own twists and tendrils that could occupy you for a lifetime, and each one gives you a new perspective 
on the big questions. And best of all, you can actually answer a few of the subquestions, and be the first
person to do so: you can permanently move the needle of human knowledge, even if only by a minuscule amount.
As I once put it, progress in math and science — think of natural selection, Godel’s and Turing’s theorems,
relativity and quantum mechanics — has repeatedly altered the terms of philosophical discussion, as
philosophical discussion itself has rarely altered them! (Of course, this is completely leaving aside math
and science’s “fringe benefit” of enabling our technological civilization, which is not chickenfeed either.)


On this view, philosophy is simply too big and too important to be confined to philosophy departments! Of 
course, the word “philosophy” used to mean the entire range of fundamental inquiry, from epistemology and
metaphysics to physics and biology (which were then called “natural philosophy”), rather than just close
textual analysis, or writing papers with names like “A Kripkean Reading of Wittgenstein’s Reading of Frege’s
Reading of Kant.” And it seems clear to me that there’s enormous scope today for “philosophy” in the former 
sense — and in particular, for people who love working on the subquestions, on pushing the frontiers of
neuroscience or computer science or physics or whatever else, but who also like to return every once in a
while to the “deep” philosophical mysteries that motivated them as children or teenagers. Admittedly, there
have been many great scientists who didn’t care at all about philosophy, or who were explicitly anti-philosophy.
But there were also scientists like Einstein, Schrodinger, Godel, Turing, or Bell, who not only read lots of
philosophy but (I would say) used it as a sort of springboard into science — in their cases, a wildly successful
one. My guess would be that science ultimately benefits from both the “pro-philosophical” and the
“anti-philosophical” temperaments, and even from the friction between them.
```

Making progress on big problems:

```markdown
Pick off smaller subquestions: ideally, subquestions that you can attack using math, empirical observation, 
or both.

whenever it’s been possible to make definite progress on ancient philosophical problems, such progress has 
almost always involved a [kind of] “bait-and-switch.” In other words: one replaces an unanswerable
philosophical riddle Q by a “merely” scientific or mathematical question Q′, which captures part of what 
people have wanted to know when they’ve asked Q. Then, with luck, one solves Q′.

Of course, even if Q′ is solved, centuries later philosophers might still be debating the exact relation 
between Q and Q′! And further exploration might lead to other scientific or mathematical questions — Q′′, Q′′′,
and so on — which capture aspects of Q that Q′ left untouched. But from my perspective, this process of 
“breaking oﬀ” answerable parts of unanswerable riddles, then trying to answer those parts, is the closest thing
to philosophical progress that there is.

…A good replacement question Q′ should satisfy two properties: (a) Q′ should capture some aspect of the original
question Q — so that an answer to Q′ would be hard to ignore in any subsequent discussion of Q, [and] (b) Q′
should be precise enough that one can see what it would mean to make progress on Q′: what experiments one would
need to do, what theorems one would need to prove, etc.

### Diseased philosophy
([overview](#overview))

From Scott Aaronson's [Quantum Computing Since Democritus](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/01/book-review-and-highlights-quantum-computing-since-democritus/):

```markdown
The third thing that annoys me about the Chinese Room argument is the way it gets so much mileage from 
a possibly misleading choice of imagery, or, one might say, by trying to sidestep the entire issue of 
computational complexity purely through clever framing. We’re invited to imagine someone pushing around 
slips of paper with zero understanding or insight, much like the doofus freshmen who write 
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 on their math tests. 

But how many slips of paper are we talking about! How big would the rule book have to be, and how 
quickly would you have to consult it, to carry out an intelligent Chinese conversation in anything 
resembling real time? If each page of the rule book corresponded to one neuron of a native speaker’s 
brain, then probably we’d be talking about a “rule book” at leas the size of the Earth, its pages 
searchable by a swarm of robots traveling at close to the speed of light. When you put it that way, 
maybe it’s not so hard to imagine this enormous Chinese-speaking entity that we’ve brought into being 
might have something we’d be prepared to call understanding or insight.

Philosophers are so good at pure qualitative distinctions that it’s easy to slip the difference between 
“guy in a room” and “planet being processed by lightspeed robots” under the rug.
```

Brandon Watson, [The Success and Failure of Arguments](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2010/09/success-and-failure-of-arguments.html):

```markdown
Sometimes you hear philosophers bemoaning the fact that philosophers tend not to form consensuses 
like certain other disciplines do (sciences in particular). 

But there is no great mystery to this. The sciences reward consensus-forming as long as certain 
procedures are followed: agreements through experimental verification, processes of peer review, etc. 
Philosophy has nothing like this. Philosophers are rewarded for coming up with creative reasons not to 
agree with other people. The whole thrust of professional philosophy is toward inventing ways to regard 
opposing arguments as failure, as long as those ways don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much 
philosophers are interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not structured so as to converge 
on it; it is structured so as to have the maximal possible divergence that can be sustained given common 
conventions. 

We are not trained to find ways to come to agree with each other; we are trained to find ways to 
disagree with each other.
```

John Perry, from the introduction to *Identity, Personal Identity, and the Self*:

```markdown
There is something about practical things that knocks us off our philosophical high horses. Perhaps Heraclitus 
really thought he couldn't step in the same river twice. Perhaps he even received tenure for that contribution 
to philosophy. But suppose some other ancient had claimed to have as much right as Heraclitus did to an ox 
Heraclitus had bought, on the grounds that since the animal had changed, it wasn't the same one he had bought 
and so was up for grabs. Heraclitus would have quickly come up with some ersatz, watered-down version of 
identity of practical value for dealing with property rights, oxen, lyres, vineyards, and the like. And then 
he might have wondered if that watered-down vulgar sense of identity might be a considerably more valuable 
concept than a pure and philosophical sort of identity that nothing has.

### Morality, axiology, law
([overview](#overview))

Scott Alexander on the distinction between axiology, morality, and law, from [this essay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/):

```markdown
Axiology is the study of what’s good. If you want to get all reductive, think of it as comparing the 
values of world-states. A world-state where everybody is happy seems better than a world-state where 
everybody is sad. A world-state with lots of beautiful art is better than a world-state containing only 
featureless concrete cubes. Maybe some people think a world-state full of people living in harmony with
nature is better than a world-state full of gleaming domed cities, and other people believe the opposite; 
when they debate the point, they’re debating axiology.

Morality is the study of what the right thing to do is. If someone says “don’t murder”, they’re making a 
moral commandment. If someone says “Pirating music is wrong”, they’re making a moral claim. Maybe some 
people believe you should pull the lever on the trolley problem, and other people believe you shouldn’t; 
when they debate the point, they’re debating morality.

(this definition elides a complicated distinction between individual conscience and social pressure; 
fixing that would be really hard and I’m going to keep eliding it)

Law is – oh, come on, you know this one. If someone says “Don’t go above the speed limit, there’s a 
cop car behind that corner”, that’s law. If someone says “my state doesn’t allow recreational marijuana,
but it will next year”, that’s law too. Maybe some people believe that zoning restrictions should ban 
skyscrapers in historic areas, and other people believe they shouldn’t; when they debate the point, 
they’re debating law.

These three concepts are pretty similar; they’re all about some vague sense of what is or isn’t desirable. 
But most societies stop short of making them exactly the same. Only the purest act-utilitarianesque 
consequentialists say that axiology exactly equals morality, and I’m not sure there is anybody quite that
pure. And only the harshest of Puritans try to legislate the state law to be exactly identical to the moral
one. To bridge the whole distance – to directly connect axiology to law and make it illegal to do anything 
other than the most utility-maximizing action at any given time – is such a mind-bogglingly bad idea that 
I don’t think anyone’s even considered it in all of human history.

These concepts stay separate because they each make different compromises between goodness, implementation, 
and coordination.

One example: axiology can’t distinguish between murdering your annoying neighbor vs. not donating money to 
savea child dying of parasitic worms in Uganda. To axiology, they’re both just one life snuffed out of the 
world beforeits time. If you forced it to draw some distinction, it would probably decide that saving the
child dying of parasitic worms was more important, since they have a longer potential future lifespan.

But morality absolutely draws this distinction: it says not-murdering is obligatory, but donating money to
Ugandais supererogatory. Even utilitarians who deny this distinction in principle will use it in everyday 
life: if theirfriend was considering not donating money, they would be a little upset; if their friend was
considering murder, they would be horrified. If they themselves forgot to donate money, they’d feel a little
bad; if they committedmurder in the heat of passion, they’d feel awful.

A final example: axiology tells us a world without alcohol would be better than our current world: ending
alcoholism could avert millions of deaths, illnesses, crimes, and abusive relationships. Morality only tells
us that we should be careful drinking and stop if we find ourselves becoming alcoholic or ruining our
relationships. And the law protests that it tried banning alcohol once, but it turned out to be unenforceable
and gave too many new opportunities to organized crime, so it’s going to stay out of this one except to say
you shouldn’t drink and drive.

So fundamentally, what is the difference between axiology, morality, and law?

Axiology is just our beliefs about what is good. If you defy axiology, you make the world worse.

At least from a rule-utilitarianesque perspective, morality is an attempt to triage the infinite demands 
of axiology, in order to make them implementable by specific people living in specific communities. It 
makes assumptions like “people have limited ability to predict the outcome of their actions”, “people 
are only going to do a certain amount and then get tired”, and “people do better with bright-line rules
than with vague gradients of goodness”. It also admits that it’s important that everyone living in a 
community is on at least kind of the same page morally, both in order to create social pressure to follow 
the rules, and in order to build the social trust that allows the community to keep functioning. If you 
defy morality, you still make the world worse. And you feel guilty. And you betray the social trust that
lets your community function smoothly. And you get ostracized as a bad person.

Law is an attempt to formalize the complicated demands of morality, in order to make them implementable
by a state with police officers and law courts. It makes assumptions like “people’s vague intuitive moral 
judgments can sometimes give different results on the same case”, “sometimes police officers and
legislators are corrupt or wrong”, and “we need to balance the benefits of laws against the cost of
enforcing them”. It also tries to avert civil disorder or civil war by assuring everybody that it’s in 
their best interests to appeal to a fair universal law code rather than try to solve their disagreements
directly. If you defy law, you still get all the problems with defying axiology and morality. And you 
make your country less peaceful and stable. And you go to jail.

In a healthy situation, each of these systems reinforces and promotes the other. Morality helps you 
implement axiology from your limited human perspective, but also helps prevent you from feeling guilty
for not being God and not being able to save everybody. The law helps enforce the most important moral
and axiological rules but also leaves people free enough to use their own best judgment on how to pursue
the others. And axiology and morality help resolve disputes about what the law should be, and then lend
the support of the community, the church, and the individual conscience in keeping people law-abiding.

In these healthy situations, the universally-agreed priority is that law trumps morality, and morality
trumps axiology. First, because you can’t keep your obligations to your community from jail, and you 
can’t work to make the world a better place when you’re a universally-loathed social outcast. But also,
because you can’t work to build strong communities and relationships in the middle of a civil war, and
you can’t work to make the world a better place from within a low-trust defect-defect equilibrium. But
also, because in a just society, axiology wants you to be moral (because morality is just a 
more-effective implementation of axiology), and morality wants you to be law-abiding (because law is 
just a more-effective way of coordinating morality). So first you do your legal duty, then your moral 
duty, and then if you have energy left over, you try to make the world a better place.

In unhealthy situations, you can get all sorts of weird conflicts. Most “moral dilemmas” are 
philosophers trying to create perverse situations where axiology and morality give opposite answers.
For example, the fat man version of the trolley problem sets axiology (“it’s obviously better to 
have a world where one person dies than a world where five people die”) against morality (“it’s a
useful rule that people generally shouldn’t push other people to their deaths”). And when morality 
and state law disagree, you get various acts of civil disobedience, from people hiding Jews from the
Nazis all the way down to Kentucky clerks refusing to perform gay marriages.

I don’t have any special insight into these. My intuition (most authoritative source! is never wrong!)
says that we should be very careful reversing the usual law-trumps-morality-trumps-axiology order, 
since the whole point of having more than one system is that we expect the systems to disagree and we 
want to suppress those disagreements in order to solve important implementation and coordination problems.
But I also can’t deny that for enough gain, I’d reverse the order in a heartbeat. If someone told me 
that by breaking a promise to my friend (morality) I could cure all cancer forever (axiology), then f@$k 
my friend, and f@$k whatever social trust or community cohesion would be lost by the transaction.

### Slack and deliberate mediocrity
([overview](#overview))

The basic idea of Slack comes from the [eponymous LW post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack). Quotes I liked, or that made sense to me:

```markdown
Definition: Slack. The absence of binding constraints on behavior.
Poor is the person without Slack. Lack of Slack compounds and traps.

Slack means margin for error. You can relax.

Slack allows pursuing opportunities. You can explore. You can trade.

Slack prevents desperation. You can avoid bad trades and wait for better spots. You can be efficient.

Slack permits planning for the long term. You can invest.

Slack enables doing things for your own amusement. You can play games. You can have fun.

Slack enables doing the right thing. Stand by your friends. Reward the worthy. Punish the wicked. 
You can have a code.

Slack presents things as they are without concern for how things look or what others think. You can 
be honest. ...

Slack in project management is the time a task can be delayed without causing a delay to either 
subsequent tasks or project completion time. The amount of time before a constraint binds.

A slacker is one who has a lazy work ethic or otherwise does not exert maximum effort. They slack off. 
They refuse to be bound by what others view as hard constraints.
```

On things being Out To Get You:

```markdown
Many things in this world are Out to Get You. Often they are Out to Get You for a lot, usually 
but not always your time, attention and money.

If you Get Got for compact amounts too often, it will add up and the constraints will bind.

If you Get Got even once for a non-compact amount, the cost expands until the you have no Slack 
left. The constraints bind you.

You might spend every spare minute and/or dollar on politics, advocacy or charity. You might think 
of every dollar as a fraction of a third-world life saved. Racing to find a cure for your daughter’s
cancer, you already work around the clock. You could have an all-consuming job or be a soldier 
marching off to war. It could be a quest for revenge, for glory, for love. Or you might spend every
spare minute mindlessly checking Facebook or obsessed with your fantasy football league.

You cannot relax. Your life is not your own.

It might even be the right choice! Especially for brief periods. When about to be run over by a truck
or evicted from your house, Slack is a luxury you cannot afford. Extraordinary times call for 
extraordinary effort.

Most times are ordinary. Make an ordinary effort.
```

Can you afford to lose Slack?

```markdown
No, you can’t. This is the most famous attack on Slack. Few words make me angrier.

The person who says “You Can Afford It” is saying to ignore constraints that do not bind you. If you 
do, all constraints soon bind you.

Those who do not value Slack soon lose it. Slack matters. Fight to keep yours!

Ask not whether you can afford it. Ask if it is Worth It.

Unless you can’t afford it. Affordability is invaluable negative selection. Never positive selection.

The You Can Afford It tax on Slack quickly approaches 100% if unchecked.

If those with extra resources are asked to share the whole surplus, all are poor or hide their wealth.
Wealth is a burden and makes you a target. Those visibly flush rush to spend their bounty.

Where those with free time are given extra work, all are busy or look busy. Those with copious free time
seek out relatively painless time sinks they can point to.

When looking happy means you deal with everything unpleasant, no one looks happy for long.
```

Venkat Rao's Maya Millennial is an example of someone who lacks Slack:

```markdown
Constraints bind her every action. Her job in life is putting up a front of the person she wants to 
show people that she wants to be. If her constraints noticeably failed to bind the illusion would fail.

Every action is being watched. If no one is around to watch her, the job falls to her. She must post 
all to Facebook, to Snapchat, to Instagram. Each action and choice signals who she is and her loyalty
to the system. Not doing that this time could mean missing her one chance to make it big.

Maya never has free time. There is signaling to do! At a minimum, she must spend such time on alert and
on her phone lest she miss something.

Maya never has spare cash. All must be spent to advance and fit her profile.

Maya lacks free speech, free association, free taste and free thought. All must serve.

Maya is in a world where she must signal she has no Slack. Slack means insufficient dedication and 
loyalty. Slack cannot be trusted. Slack now means slack later, which means failure. Future failure means 
no opportunity.
```

G Gordon Worley III comments on how Slack relates to distributed systems:

```markdown
If you work with distributed systems, by which I mean any system that must pass information between
multiple, tightly integrated subsystems, there is a well understood concept of maximum sustainable load
and we know that number to be roughly 60% of maximum possible load for all systems.

I don't have a link handy to show you the math, but the basic idea is that the probability that one 
subsystem will have to wait on another increases exponentially with the total load on the system and 
the load level that maximizes throughput (total amount of work done by the system over some period of
time) comes in just above 60%. If you do less work you are wasting capacity (in terms of throughput);
if you do more work you will gum up the works and waste time waiting even if all the subsystems are
always busy.

We normally deal with this in engineering contexts, but as is so often the case this property will hold 
for basically anything that looks sufficiently like a distributed system. Thus the "operate at 60% 
capacity" rule of thumb will maximize throughput in lots of scenarios: assembly lines, service-oriented
architecture software, coordinated work within any organization, an individual's work (since it is 
normally made up of many tasks that information must be passed between with the topology being spread
out over time rather than space), and perhaps most surprisingly an individual's mind-body.

"Slack" is a decent way of putting this, but we can be pretty precise and say you need ~40% slack to
optimize throughput: more and you tip into being "lazy", less and you become "overworked".
```

Some things that give Slack also take it away, per commenter elizabeth:

```markdown
The obvious example is cell phones. Especially at first they gave slack by letting you leave the house 
while you were waiting for an important phone call, but eventually ate it by creating an expectation 
that you'd always be available.
```

ialdabaoth contends that "this is because social structures strive to keep slack homeostatic at your level. As soon as you have more slack than you need to service your superiors in the social hierarchy, they will take that slack for themselves" but I'm not convinced of this argument. 

It's possible to have too much Slack -- I relate to this, as someone who's always subconsciously optimized for Slack myself. Per JacekLach:

```markdown
I often find myself with free time, and 'waste it away'. I don't really do anything on most weekends.
Having more constraints as guidance for behaviour in free time could likely remediate that; but I seem 
to be very good at talking myself out of any recurrent commitments, saying that they would reduce my 
freedom/flexibility/slack.

At the same time, it seems to me that I'm happiest, most 'alive', most in the 'flow', in situations with
exactly the kind of binding constraints this post talks of avoiding. The constraints focus you on the 
present, on the very moment, on being. For me this is clearest in sailing regattas - a clear purpose that
acts as a binding constraint (to go as fast as possible while staying safe - a safety margin does not for 
slack make, since you are not willing to ignore crossing it), consuming all your attention (at least during
the time you're responsible for the ship, and often more).

I suppose one can stretch the metaphor and say that having no slack on too many dimensions is likely to 
squash you; but having slack everywhere leaves you floating around aimlessly. Keeping most constraints 
slack and choosing only a couple aligned ones to bind against is possibly a way to find purpose.
```

Frustrated-demiurge talks about the same concept in her post [Affordance widths](https://frustrateddemiurge.tumblr.com/post/144927712238/affordance-widths). I *think* Venkat Rao talks about this same thing too in [this post](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/07/mediocratopia-3/), except he comes at it from a different angle. 

```markdown
There is a paradox at the heart of mediocrity studies: excellence is not actually exceptional. If 
you see an excellent behavior or thing, it’s likely to be a middling instance at its level. The 
perception of exceptionalism is an illusion caused by inappropriate comparisons: you think it is a
99 percentile example of Level 3 performance, but it’s really a median example of Level 4 performance.

Changing levels of performance is self-disruption. The moment you hit, say, the 60% performance 
point on the current S-curve of learning, you start looking for ways to level up. This is the basic 
point in Daniel F. Chambliss’ classic paper, The Mundanity of Excellence. People who rise through 
the levels of a competitive sport do so by making discrete qualitative changes to level up before 
they hit diminishing returns from the current level. This process of leveling up, has less to do 
with striving for excellence in the sense of exceptional performance, and more to do with repeatedly
growing past limits. The visibly excellent are never at a local optimum.

In Age of Speed, skier Vince Poscente claims he won primarily by practicing his skills at a level 
above the one he was competing at. So during actual competition, he could win with less than 100% 
effort.

Making winning a habit is about making sure you’re always operating at a level where you have slack;
where you are in fact mediocre. If you’re being pushed towards excellence, it’s time to find a new 
level.
```

"Leveling up before hitting diminishing returns reminds me of another great essay I recently read, Eugene Wei's [Invisible Asymptotes](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/5/21/invisible-asymptotes) post from his blog [Remains of the Day](https://www.eugenewei.com/). It's pretty long, but full of great stuff. The relevant part is this:

```markdown
Every successful business goes through the famous S-curve, and most companies, and their investors,
spend a lot of time looking for that inflection point towards hockey-stick growth. But just as 
important, and perhaps less well studied, is that unhappy point later in the S-curve, when you hit
a shoulder and experience a flattening of growth. ...

For so many startups and even larger tech incumbents, the point at which they hit the shoulder in
the S-curve is a mystery, and I suspect the failure to see it occurs much earlier. The good thing is
that identifying the enemy sooner allows you to address it. We focus so much on product-market fit,
but once companies have achieved some semblance of it, most should spend much more time on the 
problem of product-market unfit.

For me, in strategic planning, the question in building my forecast was to flush out what I call the
invisible asymptote: a ceiling that our growth curve would bump its head against if we continued down
our current path. It's an important concept to understand for many people in a company, whether a CEO, 
a product person, or, as I was back then, a planner in finance. ...

An obvious problem for many companies, however, is that they are creating new types of businesses and 
services that don't lend themselves to easily identifying such invisible asymptotes. Many are not like
Amazon where there are readily tracked metrics like the size of the global book market with which to
peg their TAM (total addressable market).

Some of the limits to their growth are easier to spot than others. For messaging and some more general
social networking apps, for example, in many cases network effects are geographical. Since these apps 
build on top of real-world social graphs, and many of those are geographically clustered, there are 
winner-take-all dynamics such that in many countries one messaging app dominates, like Kakao in Korea 
or Line in Taiwan. There can be geo-political considerations, too, that help ensure that that WeChat 
will dominate in China to the exclusion of all competitors, for example.

For others, though, it takes a bit more product insight, and some might say intuition, to see the 
ceiling before you bump into it. For both employees and investors, understanding product-market unfit 
follows very closely on identifying product-market fit as an existential challenge.

<a name="#moloch"></a>
### Moloch
([overview](#overview))

Like LW commenter Quinn, I had difficulty summarizing Scott Alexander's celebrated essay *Moloch*, even though it was one of the most impactful pieces I've ever read. So I appreciate that he's conveniently summarized it SparkNotes-style under Stuart Armstrong's [essay](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/otES8gdmFszCvZiRy/moloch-optimisation-and-vs-or-information-and-sacrificial):

```markdown
Intro - no real content.

Moloch as coordination failure: everyone makes a sacrifice to optimize for a zero-sum 
competition,ends up with the same relative status, but worse absolute status.

10 examples: 
- Prisoner's Dilemma, 
- dollar auctions, 
- fish-farming story (tragedy of the commons), 
- Malthusian trap, 
- ruthless/exploitative Capitalist markets, 
- the two-income trap, 
- agriculture, 
- arms races, 
- cancer, 
- political race to the bottom (lowering taxes to attract business)

4 partial examples: 
- inefficient education, 
- inefficient science, 
- government corruption (corporate welfare), 
- Congress (representatives voting against good of nation for good of constituency)

Existing systems are created by incentive structures, not agents, e.g. Las Vegas caused by 
a known bias in human reward circuitry, not optimization for human values.

But sometimes we move uphill anyway. Possible explanations:

- Excess resources / we are in the dream time and can afford non-competitive behavior.
- Physical limitations to what can be sacrificed
- Economic competition actually producing positive utility for consumers (but this is fragile)
- Coordination, e.g. via governments, guilds, friendships, etc.

Technology/ingenuity creates new opportunities to fall into such traps: 
- Technology overcomes physical limitations, consumes excess resources. 
- Automation further decouples economic activity from human values. 
- Technology can improve coordination, but can also exacerbate existing conflicts by giving all 
sides more power.

AGI opens up whole new worlds of traps: 
- Yudkowsky's paperclipper, 
- Hanson's subsistence-level ems, 
- Bostrom's Disneyland with no children.

6 & 7. Gnon - basically the god of the conservative scarcity mindset. Nick Land advocates 
compliance; Nyan wants to capture Gnon and build a walled garden. Scott warns that Moloch is 
far more terrifying than Gnon and will kill both of them anyway.

8 & 9. So we have to kill this Moloch guy, by lifting a better God to Heaven (Elua).
```

Wei Dai points out that this is captured by the standard academic notion of [positional good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_good). Robert Frank, in [an article on higher ed](https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ffp0001s.pdf), calls Moloch a "positional arms race":

```markdown
Participants in virtually all winner-take-all markets face strong incentives to invest in performance
enhancement, thereby to increase their chances of coming out ahead. As in the classic military arms 
race, however, many such investments prove mutually offsetting in the end. When each nation spends more
on bombs, the balance of power is no different than if none had spent more. Yet that fact alone provides
no escape for individual participants. Countries may find it burdensome to spend a lot on bombs, but the 
alternative—to be less well-armed than their rivals—is even worse.

In light of the growing importance of rank in the education marketplace, universities face increasing 
pressure to bid for the various resources that facilitate the quest for high rank. These pressures have 
spawned a positional arms race that already has proved extremely costly, and promises to become more so.

### Critiques of the anthropic principle
([overview](#overview))

Funny if uncharitable quote by Cosma Shalizi from the introduction to his notebook [Astrophysics and Cosmology](http://bactra.org/notebooks/astrophysics.html):

```markdown
There are interesting issues of statistical mechanics involved, since there are long-range 
interactions: gravity falls off only slowly with distance r-2, after all), and, unlike 
electromagnetism, there are no positive and negative charges which could lead to screening off.
This leads to some weird effects, like spontaneous clumping, and possibilities like negative 
specific heats.

A personal hatred: the anthropic principle. To illustrate: I once happened --- no joke --- to 
find a twenty dollar bill lying in the street in front of my house. This required an extraordinarily
fine adjustment of a huge range of circumstances. Among these, of course, were the incidents of
American history such that we use paper money, denominated in dollars, that the twenty is a common
but large denomination, and that Andrew Jackson's portait be on it. This last involves our political
history through and indeed since Jackson's time. That political history is incomprehensible without 
the influence of the Enlightenment, and of the ideological struggles of 17th century England (no
Lockean possessive individualism, no Jacksonian democracy). Those struggles were intimately tied to
England's political and military history in the 17th century, which is only comprehensible in light of
(among much else) the Norman Invasion, which in turn was only possible given the condition of Anglo-
Saxon England in 1066, but there would have been no Anglo-Saxon England had there not first been a 
Roman Britain. There would have been no Roman Britain had Britain not already been partly integrated 
into the broader trading network, which was largely on account, then, of its metals. 

So, reasoning anthropically, I can conclude, from my stray twenty, that it was necessary that there be
tin in southern Britain.
```

Cosma also led me to this paper by Lee Smolin, [Scientific alternatives to the anthropic principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0407213), whose abstract is just as blunt:

```markdown
It is explained in detail why the Anthropic Principle (AP) cannot yield any falsifiable predictions,
and therefore cannot be a part of science. Cases which have been claimed as successful predictions 
from the AP are shown to be not that. Either they are uncontroversial applications of selection 
principles in one universe (as in Dicke's argument), or the predictions made do not actually logically 
depend on any assumption about life or intelligence, but instead depend only on arguments from
observed facts (as in the case of arguments by Hoyle and Weinberg). The Principle of Mediocrity is
also examined and shown to be unreliable, as arguments for factually true conclusions can easily be
modified to lead to false conclusions by reasonable changes in the specification of the ensemble in 
which we are assumed to be typical. 

We show however that it is still possible to make falsifiable predictions from theories of 
multiverses, if the ensemble predicted has certain properties specified here. An example of such a 
falsifiable multiverse theory is cosmological natural selection. It is reviewed here and it is argued
that the theory remains unfalsified. But it is very vulnerable to falsification by current observations,
which shows that it is a scientific theory.
```

Cosma thinks Smolin is right on the money:

```markdown
Take, for instance, the example he gives in section 5.1.3. Fred Hoyle once reasoned that carbon is 
necessary for life, that carbon must have been formed by stellar nucleosynthesis, and that this reaction
could only have proceeded if carbon nuclei had certain properties, which experimentalists then proceeded
to show they did have. Smolin fairly schematizes this as follows. 

(1) X is necessary for life (or intelligence, etc.). 
(2) X is, as it happens, true. 
(3) If X is true, and the laws of physics are Y, then Z must also be true. 
(4) Therefore Z.

We see clearly that the prediction of Z in no way depends on step 1. The argument has the same force if 
step 1 is removed. To see this ask what we would do were Z found not to be true. Our only option would be
to question either Y or the deduction from the presently known laws of physics to Z. We might conclude 
that the deduction was wrong, for example if we made a mistake in a calculation. If no such option worked,
we might have to conclude that the laws of physics might have to be modified. But we would never question 1,
because, while a true fact, it plays no role in the logic of the argument leading to the prediction for Z.
```

There are actually seven subsections that Smolin devotes to 'varieties of the anthropic principle'; feel free to check them out.

Piet Hein:

```markdown
The road to wisdom? --- Well, it's plain
and simple to express:

 Err
 and err

 but less

 and less.
```

Peter Medawar:

```markdown
Most scientists receive no tuition in scientific method, but those who have been instructed perform 
no better as scientists than those who have not. Of what other branch of learning can it be said that 
it gives its proficients no advantage; that it need not be taught or, if taught, need not be learned?
```

Cosma Shalizi:

```markdown
It’s much easier to get rid of wrong notions than it is to find correct ones, if the latter is 
possible at all.
```

Cosma Shalizi again, this time on an interesting argument for how “good statistics” should be defined (cf. [Properties versus Principles debate](http://bactra.org/notebooks/properties-vs-principles-for-statistics.html)):

```markdown
In his book The Theory of Literary Criticism, John Ellis argues that it's a mistake to try to define 
many categories in terms of criteria which are applicable to the objects of the categories in themselves; 
they are rather defined (in large part) by their relations to us and to our purposes. The really persuasive 
(to me) example is "weed": a weed is simply an obnoxious plant. Plants may be obnoxious because they are 
fast-growing, hardy, perennial, etc., etc., but none of these properties, or any Boolean combination 
thereof, *defines* weeds; their relation to our purposes in gardening does. It's perfectly sensible to say 
"kudzu is a weed, and one of the reasons why is that it grows so fast", but fast growth doesn't define weeds. 
The quest for criteria or defining principles of weed-hood is (if I may put it this way) fruitless.

I wonder if one can't say something similar about good statistics? What makes something a good method of 
statistical inference is that it gives us a reliable, low-error way of drawing conclusions from data. The 
reasons why a given procedure is reliable, and the ways we find them, are many and various. In the case of 
the Neyman-Pearson lemma, we directly minimize error probabilities; but sometimes we maximize likelihood, 
sometimes we use conditioning to update prior probability distributions, etc. None of these --- particularly 
the last --- *defines* a reliable way of learning from data.

### The role of statistics in science
([overview](#overview))

This quote from Cosma's [book review](http://bactra.org/reviews/error/) of Deborah Mayo's *Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge* contains the most inventive and *original* description of Popperian falsification I’ve ever seen:

```markdown
In our own time, Medawar's friend Karl Popper achieved (fully deserved) eminence by tenacious 
insistence on the importance of this point, becoming a sort of Lenin of the philosophy of science. 
Instead of conferring patents of epistemic nobility, lawdoms and theoryhoods, on certain hypotheses, 
Popper hauled them all before an Anglo-Austrian Tribunal of Revolutionary Empirical Justice.

The procedure of the court was as follows: the accused was blindfolded, and the magistrates then formed 
a firing squad, shooting at it with every piece of possibly-refuting observational evidence they could 
find. Conjectures who refused to present themselves might lead harmless lives as metaphysics without 
scientific aspirations; conjectures detected peaking out from under the blindfold, so as to dodge the 
Tribunal's attempts at refutation, were declared pseudo-scientific and exiled from the Open Society of 
Science. Our best scientific theories, those Stakhanovites of knowledge, consisted of those conjectures 
which had survived harsh and repeated sessions before the Tribunal, demonstrated their loyalty to the 
Open Society by appearing before it again and again and offering the largest target to refutation that 
they could, and so retained their place in the revolutionary vanguard until they succumbed, or were 
displaced by another conjecture with even greater zeal for the Great Purge.

As Popper famously said, better our hypotheses die for our errors than ourselves... It's an answer with 
nice, clean lines, and makes lots of sense to the scientist-at-the-bench, like Medawar.

Alas, the Revolution runs into trouble on several fronts, for instance statistics.
```

Say more words? 

```markdown
Suppose I tell you that a certain slot machine will pay out money 99% of the time. Being credulous, unnaturally patient, and abundantly supplied with coins, you play it 10,000 times and find that it pays out only twice. This is sufficient for you to tell me to get stuffed, if not to sue, and one would think that it would be enough for the Tribunal to shoot my poor conjecture dead, but actually it escapes unharmed. The problem for Uncle Karl is that getting two successes in ten thousand trials is possible given my assertion, and the Tribunal is only authorized to eliminate conjectures in actual contradiction to the facts, as "no mammals lay eggs" is contradicted by the platypus. Popper realized this, and worried about it, eventually saying that we just have to make "risky decisions" about when to reject statistical hypotheses.

But the challenges facing the Tribunal in the execution of its duty mount: another "risky decision" is required, about what ammunition the firing squad can legitimately use, i.e., about what evidence will be accepted when we see whether or not a hypothesis stands up. (The number of times my students have apparently refuted physical laws gives me great sympathy for the European naturalists who refused to accept reports of the platypus's peculiarities for decades.) 

Then there is the problem of conjectural conspiracy: an isolated hypothesis almost never leads to anything we can test observationally; it is only in combination with "auxiliary" hypotheses, sometimes very many of them indeed, that is gives us actionable predictions. But then if a prediction proves false, all we learn is that at least one of our hypotheses is wrong, not which ones are the saboteurs. So far as deductive rectitude is concerned, we are free to frame whichever auxiliaries we like least, and save our favorite hypothesis from execution at the hands of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal even, for all its appearance of salutary rigor, lets far too many suspects go: every conjecture which is compatible with the evidence. These last two problems, respectively those of Quine-Duhem and of methodological underdetermination, are so severe that they form the core of the (intellectually respectable) argument for the counter-revolutionary deviation of scientific relativism. (The argument throttles itself neatly, but that's a subject for another essay.) 

Yet in ordinary life, never mind science, we evade these problems --- those of testing statistical hypotheses, of selecting evidence, of Quine-Duhem, of methodological underdetermination --- every time we change a light-bulb, so something has clearly gone very wrong here (as, in revolutions, things are wont to do).
```

Deborah Mayo on Popper being too soft with conjectures:

```markdown
Although Popper's work is full of exhortations to put hypotheses through the wringer, to make them "suffer 
in our stead in the struggle for the survival of the fittest," the tests Popper sets out are white-glove 
affairs of logical analysis. If anomalies are approached with white gloves, it is little wonder that they 
seem to tell us only that there is an error somewhere and that they are silent about its source. We have 
to become shrewd inquisitors of errors, interact with them, simulate them (with models and computers), 
amplify them: we have to learn to make them talk.
```

Where does Mayo come into the picture?

```markdown
Fortunately, scientists have not only devoted much effort to making errors talk, they have even developed
a theory of inquisition, in the form of mathematical statistics, especially the theory of statistical
inference worked out by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson in the 1930s. Mayo's mission is largely to show how
this very standard mathematical statistics justifies a very large class of scientific inferences, those 
concerned with "experimental knowledge," and to suggest that the rest of our business can be justified on
similar grounds. Statistics becomes a kind of applied methodology, as well as the "continuation of 
experiment by other means."

Mayo's key notion is that of a severe test of a hypothesis, one with "an overwhelmingly good chance of
revealing the presence of a specific error, if it exists --- but not otherwise" (p. 7). More formally
(when we can be this formal), the severity of a passing result is the probability that, if the hypothesis
is false, our test would have given results which match the hypothesis less well than the ones we actually
got do, taking the hypothesis, the evidence used in the test, and the way of calculating fit between
hypothesis and evidence to be fixed. If a severe test does not turn up the error it looks for, it's good
grounds for thinking that the error is absent. By putting our hypotheses through a battery of severe 
tests, screening them for the members of our "error repertoire," our "canonical models of error," we can 
come to have considerable confidence that they are not mistaken in those respects. Instead of a method for
infallibly or even reliably finding truths, we have a host of methods for reliably finding errors: which
turns out to be good enough.

Experimental inquiry, for Mayo, consist of breaking down the question at hand into a series of small bits, 
each of which is relatively easily subjected to severe tests for error, or (depending on how you look at
it) is itself a severe probe for a certain error. In doing this we construct a "hierarchy of models" (an 
idea of Patrick Suppes's, here greatly elaborated). In particular, we need data models, models of how the
data are collected and massaged. "Error" here, as throughout Mayo's work, must be understood in a rather
catholic sense: any deviation from the conditions we assumed in our reasoning about what the experimental
outcomes should be. If we guess that a certain effect (the bending of spoons, let us say) is due to a
certain cause (e.g., the psychic powers of Mr. Uri Geller), it is not enough that spoons bend reliably in
his presence: we must also rule out other mechanisms which would produce the same effect (Mr. Geller's 
bending the spoons with his hands while we're not looking, his substituting pre-bent spoons for unbent 
ones ditto, etc., through material for several lawsuits for libel). But this solves the Quine-Duhem problem.

In fact, it gets better. Recall that methodological underdetermination (which goes by the apt name of MUD 
in Error) is the worry that no amount or quality of evidence will suffice to pick out one theory as the best,
because there are always indefinitely many others which are in equal accord with that evidence, or, to use 
older language, equally well save the phenomena. But saving the phenomena is not the same as being subjected
to a severe test: and, says Mayo, the point is severe testing. While I'm mostly persuaded by this argument,
I'm less sanguine than Mayo is about our ability to always find experimental tests which will let us
discriminate between two hypotheses. I'm fully persuaded that this kind of testing really does underwrite 
our knowledge of phenomena, of (in Nancy Cartwright's phrase) "nature's capacities and their measurement," 
and Mayo herself insists on the importance of experimental knowledge in just this sense (e.g., the remarks 
on "asking the wrong question," pp. 188--9). I'm less persuaded that we can usually or even often make 
justified inferences from this "formal" sort of experimental knowledge, knowledge of the distribution of 
experimental outcomes, to "substantive" statements about objects, processes and the like (e.g., from the
experimental success of quantum mechanics to wave-functions). As an unreconstructed (undeconstructed?) 
scientific realist, I make such inferences, and would like them to be justified, but find myself left hanging.

Distributions of experimental outcomes, then, are the key objects for Mayo's tests, especially the standard 
Neyman-Pearson statistical tests. The kind of probabilities Mayo, and Neyman and Pearson, use are
probabilities of various things happening: meaning that the probability of a certain result, p(A), is the 
proportion of times A occurs in many repetitions of the experiment, its frequency. This is a very familiar 
sense of probability; it's the one we invoke when we say that a fair coin has a 50% probability of coming up
heads, that the chance of getting three sixes with fair (six-sided!) dice is 1 in 216, that a certain 
laboratory procedure will make an indicator chemical change from red to blue 95% of the time when a toxin 
is present. Or, more to the present point: "the hypothesis is significant at the five percent level" means 
"the hypothesis passed the test, and the probability of its doing so, if it were false, is no more than five
percent," which means "if the hypothesis is false, and we repeated this experiment many times, we would
expect to get results inside our passing range no more than five percent of the time."
```

So Mayo is a frequentist.

### Statistical literacy
([overview](#overview))

Carl Shulman's [Research advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_yuuheVqp1quDfkuRcpoW_HO7jPaI7QnRjF1zl_VovU/edit) has the following bit on statistical literacy which I feel really strongly about and wholeheartedly endorse:

```markdown
Use basic arithmetic and statistics frequently and briefly as part of thinking rather than as occasional or 
separate exercises. … Try to convert qualitative claims into quantitative Fermi estimates whenever possible.

In my experience people almost never do enough Fermis with look-ups from Wiki//government sources. And 
especially they have too high a barrier to doing it and won't do it in casual conversation or exploration.

Sometimes it's because talking is not about information and other things are shinier. Some people are afraid 
they'll be wrong, and don't trust their ability to do it (and don't test that). Sometimes it’s because of a 
lack of affordance/habit/knowing about the bigger and standard resources or the basic toolkits of Fermis: 
prices, populations, sales. Sometimes it’s issues with arithmetic and basic statistics fluency/aversion. 
Sometimes because it gives an unwelcome answer.

Worked examples with numbers and realistic figures erode plausible deniability and attractive lies, and force 
explicit claims, use of evidence, and argument.

### Why Tricki failed
([overview](#overview)

A couple quotes from Tim Gowers’ post [Is the Tricki dead?](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/is-the-tricki-dead/) saved for future personal reference, answering some questions I’ve had in mind for awhile (and many I hadn’t).

What was the Tricki for?

```markdown
The hope was that after the site had reached some level of completeness, it would be possible to
take a mathematics research problem (or subproblem) and search efficiently for known techniques 
that were likely to be relevant.

It would be doing something a little different from Wikipedia mathematics articles, which concentrate
more on what I like to think of as “things with names”. For instance, if you suspect that discrete 
Fourier analysis is likely to be a useful tool for your problem, then you can type “discrete Fourier 
analysis” into Google and find many links, including to a Wikipedia article that contains many of the
basic facts.

But what if it doesn’t occur to you that discrete Fourier analysis is what you need (even though it in
fact is)? The idea was that, using easily identifiable features of your problem, you would be able to
follow links to ever more specific Tricki pages until you would reach a page that explained *when* 
discrete Fourier analysis was useful and *how* it was used. In general, the whole site would be about how
to do mathematics rather than about lists of facts.
```

One of Gowers’ strongest motivations:

```markdown
the thought that one day the [automated theorem proving] programmers would be able to do all the low-level 
stuff and the Tricki would be able to tell them how to do the higher-level stuff.
```

He notes that the ‘activation energy’ required to write a Tricki article is prohibitively high:

```markdown
I still believe in this general concept, but for a wiki-type site to be successful it must reach the stage
where people think it is worth contributing. Since writing a good Tricki article takes a bit of work, the 
motivation to do it has to be particularly high. And it seems that it is not high enough for the site to 
have taken off.
```

One-time contributor Emmanuel Kowalski agrees:

```markdown
I still like the idea of the Tricki a lot. For me, the difficulty in writing more articles is that 
I feel that a Tricki article should be well-written, in a way which is different from either a blog
post, or a MathOverflow question or answer. And this means it involves more time — I typically write
blog posts in one sitting, and would dash off an answer to a MO question as I would a comment to a 
blog post, but when I wrote the only Tricki article I have done, it was more like writing a short 
survey paper. Unfortunately, time is difficult to find for such contributions, at least for me…
```

This is related to the following comment by Joseph Malkevitch:

```markdown
Unfortunately, for those contributors to Tricki who are academic mathematicians (employees of mathematics
departments) there is little career incentive to writing or developing materials of this kind.

Perhaps there might be a group of people who would volunteer to be “editors” for certain pieces of Tricki 
and when these individuals saw a post to MO, journal article, or web article, with content related to the
area they “supervise,” they could contact the author of that item to modify if for posting on Tricki. The
fact that there is less work in adapting something nice that has been done already compared with creating
something new from scratch may encourage more contributions.
```

The part about lack of career incentive reminds me of Chris Olah’s [Research Debt](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) essay, under ‘Where are the Distillers?’:

```markdown
Like the theoretician, the experimentalist or the research engineer, the research distiller is an integral 
role for a healthy research community. Right now, almost no one is filling it.

Why do researchers not work on distillation? One possibility is perverse incentives, like wanting your 
work to look difficult. Those certainly exist, but we don’t think they’re the main factor.

Another possibility is that they don’t enjoy research distillation. Again, we don’t think that’s what’s
going on.

Lots of people want to work on research distillation. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to do so, 
because we don’t support them.

An aspiring research distiller lacks many things that are easy to take for granted: a career path, places
to learn, examples and role models. Underlying this is a deeper issue: their work isn’t seen as a real 
research contribution. We need to fix this.
```

And then MO came along:

```markdown
During that time, a new factor has come into play: Mathoverflow. For the Tricki to be successful, it 
had to do something that Wikipedia doesn’t do. And now, to be successful, it would also have to do 
something that Mathoverflow doesn’t do. This is a serious point: I used to think that one of the main
functions of the Tricki would be to make it much easier for people to find out what was known about 
a problem, but Mathoverflow seems to me to be a better way of doing that. …

Is there, at least in principle, still a niche for the Tricki, or is it squeezed out by Wikipedia on 
the static side and Mathoverflow on the dynamic side?
```

What niche might Tricki still occupy that hasn’t been taken by MO?

```markdown
I’m thinking of questions along the lines of “This problem that has just emerged is of a kind I haven’t
seen before but it feels as though people ought to have thought about similar things; what should I do
now?” Obviously Mathoverflow would be useful for some such problems, but sometimes they are a bit too 
vague, sometimes one might have a subproblem that one does not wish to make public, and sometimes they 
may be sufficiently easy that one would prefer just to look up the answer rather than bother other 
people with the question.

[Also] if the Tricki became more complete, then one could browse it more systematically than either 
Wikipedia or Mathoverflow. One could for example decide to read up on all the standard techniques in
some subarea.
```

Some comments by Greg Graviton:

```markdown
First of all, I think the quality of the articles on the Tricki is excellent and well worth preserving
in form or another, for instance the discussion of homology as “linear combinations of level lines
(lines/surfaces where a function is constant)”. Most importantly, you can’t find this stuff elsewhere
except in informal discussions with other mathematicians. There ought to be a place to make that public.

Concerning the format, I think the current technology of the Tricki fails to deliver your original 
“promise” of a powerful search function, that somehow helps you from nothing to a trick that applies.
This is a hard problem, it’s not sure whether it can be solved with computers, and bolting the Tricki 
on top of a Drupal installation apparently does not really solve anything. (On the technology note, note
that MathOverflow was programmed from scratch as well, so a fresh start is quite unavoidable, not to 
mention that even small issues in usability (e.g. sluggish to load) matter a lot.)
```

I think the Tricki failed for the same reason Arbital failed: [Arbital postmortem](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAgJJa3HLSZxsuSrf/arbital-postmortem). Arbital was much more ambitious in both goal and execution attempt, as you can see from reading the linked postmortem.

Continuing with Greg:

```markdown
Then, there is the “bandwidth” problem of human communication. The fastest way to convey a
mathematical concept or trick is to present it to your colleague on the blackboard. It takes 
very little effort on your part because a lot of information per time is being exchanged: mistakes,
mnemonics, steps are weighted by difficulty and importance, questions can be asked, etc. etc. 
In contrast, the amount of information that a written article can transfer is very small and it 
takes a lot of effort and skill to maximize its utility.
```

Anytime mathematical communication is brought up I’m always reminded of Bill Thurston’s essay [On proof and progress in mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236), in particular this quote:

```markdown
Much of the difficulty has to do with the language and culture of mathematics, which is divided 
into subfields. Basic concepts used every day within one subfield are often foreign to another 
subfield. Mathematicians give up on trying to understand the basic concepts even from neighboring 
subfields, unless they were clued in as graduate students.

In contrast, communication works very well within the subfields of mathematics. Within a subfield,
people develop a body of common knowledge and known techniques. By informal contact, people learn 
to understand and copy each other’s ways of thinking, so that ideas can be explained clearly and easily.

Mathematical knowledge can be transmitted amazingly fast within a subfield. When a significant theorem
is proved, it often (but not always) happens that the solution can be communicated in a matter of 
minutes from one person to another within the subfield. The same proof would be communicated and
generally understood in an hour talk to members of the subfield. It would be the subject of a 15- or
20-page paper, which could be read and understood in a few hours or perhaps days by members of the 
subfield.

Why is there such a big expansion from the informal discussion to the talk to the paper? One-on-one,
people use wide channels of communication that go far beyond formal mathematical language. They use 
gestures, they draw pictures and diagrams, they make sound effects and use body language. Communication
is more likely to be two-way, so that people can concentrate on what needs the most attention. With 
these channels of communication, they are in a much better position to convey what’s going on, not
just in their logical and linguistic facilities, but in their other mental facilities as well.

In talks, people are more inhibited and more formal. Mathematical audiences are often not very good at
asking the questions that are on most people’s minds, and speakers often have an unrealistic preset 
outline that inhibits them from addressing questions even when they are asked. In papers, people are
still more formal. Writers translate their ideas into symbols and logic, and readers try to translate 
back.

People familiar with ways of doing things in a subfield recognize various patterns of statements or 
formulas as idioms or circumlocution for certain concepts or mental images. But to people not already 
familiar with what’s going on the same patterns are not very illuminating; they are often even 
misleading. The language is not alive except to those who use it.
```

Back to Greg:

```markdown
Related is the question of rewards. It’s rewarding to publish a paper (career) or book (fame), and 
it’s rewarding to talk to other people (see MathOverflow). There is no reward associated with a tricki
article, also because the appreciation by a reader happens at a different time than when the article 
is written.

However, I think there is room for the Tricki as a “MathOverflow for intuition questions”. The idea is
that a Tricki article could be initiated as a discussion between people and then transformed into a
proper article by volunteers. By the way, this is how the community wiki feature of StackOverflow/
MathOverflow was originally supposed to work. I think it’s still possible to do that, albeit with a 
software that encourages the corresponding behavior better than MathOverlfow currently does.

Again, note that building such software and community is a very hardproblem! A simple wiki software
probably won’t cut it, simply because it doesn’t encourage the right behavior. To get an impression of
its hardness, remember that Wikipedia’s success could not have been planned, it was just the fittest to
survive, and that MathOverflow didn’t get the community wiki thing right either. This is not intended to
discourage, I’d just like to point out that a successful Tricki probably needs more cleverness than is 
apparent at first.
```

Xamuel notes that “you almost have to already know what trick you need before you can search for it”:

```markdown
Take for example the problem “Prove every vector space has a basis”. If you don’t already know how
to do it, you aren’t likely to know to search for keywords like “make something maximal”, “extend
something one thing at a time”, much less “Zorn’s Lemma”.

If I were designing the Tricki, I would set it up like this. There would be articles for individual
problems, and articles about techniques. The former would link to the latter. I would then fill it up
with as many “stock” problems (mostly from undergrad math) as I could. Essentially it would be like 
[Example Problems](http://exampleproblems.com/), except, instead of just giving the solutions, it would link to the pages for the 
techniques used in the solution. As the number of problems grew, this would be much more efficient
than ultimately writing the same techniques over and over and over (which is what you’d do if you took
an Example Problems site to its logical conclusion).

So for example it would have a page “Prove every vector space has a basis” which would in turn link to
“How to use Zorn’s Lemma” as well as maybe “Partially ordering sets by inclusion”, and any other 
technique pages that might be relevant.
```

Terry Tao notes that MO takes advantage of [Metcalfe’s law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law), whereas the Tricki doesn’t:

```markdown
If N people ask questions and N people read [MO] to answer questions, there are O(N^2) opportunities 
for a question to be answered.

In contrast, to write a Tricki article, one of N people must come up with the idea and then write at 
least a stub article, and so there are only about O(N) opportunities for such an article to be created.
```

Gowers notes that MO can help Tricki:

```markdown
One of the difficulties in writing a Tricki article is that it can be hard to think of examples. 
For example (!) I know that the trick of making something easier by generalizing it is frequently
useful. But if I try to think of a good example my mind goes a bit blank, which is part of the reason
I have not written such an article.

However, the job has just got easier: if I post a big-list question on MO asking for good examples of
this technique, I can be pretty sure of getting some excellent ones. Then I can base an article on
people’s answers and include a link to the MO discussion (partly to credit people with their help, and
partly because the discussion will be different and will therefore offer more than the Tricki article
on its own).
```

Vipul Naik contends that what the Tricki needed was at least a handful of super-passionate contributors, probably in the vein of [r/slatestarcodex - Most of What You Read on the Internet is Written by Insane People](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9rvroo/most_of_what_you_read_on_the_internet_is_written/):

```markdown
I think there’s a general perception here that what needs to be done is get a large number of 
contributors. But I think that at this stage, if the Tricki needs to grow, it needs just 2-5 very 
passionate contributors, who agitate day and night about continually improving the organisation, 
adding new articles, etc. Large numbers of diffused contributions could take over at a later stage,
but they won’t do the trick at this stage.

For instance, the psychology wiki here: http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki... was written almost 
completely by one person at least for the first few years — now there are contributions from large
numbers of people.

The story is a little different with something like Math Overflow, because it is not primarily an 
information corpus as a place to ask and answer questions. But even there, it is the dedicated few 
who monitor the site who made sure that it took off. The need for that “dedicated few” in the case 
of the Tricki would be substantially more.
```

Commenter probable trickipedian mentions non-academic mathematicians as potential contributors, due to their specialized domain knowledge:

```markdown
One likely source of Tricki contributors – not for deep mathematics, but useful applied math “tricks”
– would be people who use mathematics for our research, but are not necessarily academic mathematicians.
For instance, I have (over the years) built a collection of definite integrals not found in standard 
“tables of integrals”; because they occur in (my) somewhat obscure research area, they are generally 
unknown outside it.

I (obviously) cannot publish such work in the journals of my discipline, and the techniques are too 
classical and elementary to constitute modern mathematics research, but it would be nice if I could 
post them on a well-trafficked public venue and someone else found it useful. I could supply (weak) 
proofs or justifications for them and have verified them to the best of my abilities, though the proofs
would certainly not meet the standards of rigor required by pure mathematicians. If a mathematician
could ‘vet’ them, I would be pleased to get a login and contribute.
```

Phi. Isett argues that the Tricki could be enhanced by integrating it with online, publicly-written math books:

```markdown
For example, usually a textbook will use a well-known and common trick at some stage in a proof, but 
will rarely have the opportunity to give much insight into the trick itself, its origins, its limits,
alternative methods, etc. All too often, the first time you see a trick, it is also much more complicated
than the most basic example of its use, which makes it harder to digest. Imagine you learned the Fourier
transform before you ever diagonalized a matrix… You might not know why it has certain magical properties
when it comes to translations and differentiation — in any event, it’s useful to understand that 
diagonalizing commuting operators is a truly general trick.

Often the trick appears as an ingenious technical detail in a proof. For example: the proof of Sard’s 
theorem uses this trick you might call “decomposing the total change into small changes”. ...You may 
recognize this trick from a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but maybe you didn’t see it
coming. Or you might find it enlightening to see the same trick in other contexts and in a much more 
general light. If you can link to the Tricki, then the individual techniques can be explored separately
and generally without disturbing the flow of the exposition.

### Solving famous open problems
([overview](#overview))

(See also Scott Aaronson on [making progress on big problems](#general-philosophy) in philosophy.)

From Terry Tao's post [Be sceptical of your own work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-sceptical-of-your-own-work/):

```markdown
Actual solutions to a major problem tend to be arrived at by a process more like the following (often 
involving several mathematicians over a period of years or decades, with many of the intermediate steps 
described here being significant publishable papers in their own right):

1. Isolate a toy model case x of major problem X.
2. Solve model case x using method A.
3. Try using method A to solve the full problem X.
4. This does not succeed, but method A can be extended to handle a few more model cases of X, such as 
x’ and x”.
5. Eventually, it is realised that method A relies crucially on a property P being true; this property is 
known for x, x’, and x”, thus explaining the current progress so far.
6. Conjecture that P is true for all instances of problem X.
7. Discover a family of counterexamples y, y’, y”, … to this conjecture. This shows that either method A 
has to be adapted to avoid reliance on P, or that a new method is needed.
8. Take the simplest counterexample y in this family, and try to prove X for this special case. Meanwhile, 
try to see whether method A can work in the absence of P.
9. Discover several counterexamples in which method A fails, in which the cause of failure can be 
definitively traced back to P. Abandon efforts to modify method A.
10. Realise that special case y is related to (or at least analogous to) a problem z in another field 
of mathematics. Look up the literature on z, and ask experts in that field for the latest perspectives on 
that problem.
11. Learn that z has been successfully attacked in that field by use of method B. Attempt to adapt method 
B to solve y.
12. After much effort, an adapted method B’ is developed to solve y.
13. Repeat the above steps 1-12 with A replaced by B’ (the outcome will of course probably be a little different 
from the sample storyline presented above). Continue doing this for a few years, until all model special cases 
can be solved by one method or another.
14. Eventually, one possesses an array of methods that can give partial results on X, each of having their 
strengths and weaknesses. Considerable intuition is gained as to the circumstances in which a given method 
is likely to yield something non-trivial or not.
15. Begin combining the methods together, simplifying the execution of these methods, locating new model 
problems, and/or finding a unified and clarifying framework in which many previous methods, insights, 
results, etc. become special cases.
16. Eventually, one realises that there is a family of methods A^* (of which A was the first to be discovered) 
which, roughly speaking, can handle all cases in which property P^* (a modern generalisation of property P) 
occurs. There is also a rather different family of methods B^* which can handle all cases in which Q^* occurs.
17. From all the prior work on this problem, all known model examples are known to obey either P^* or Q^*. 
Formulate Conjecture C: all cases of problem X obey either P^* or Q*^.
18. Verify that Conjecture C in fact implies the problem. This is a major reduction!
19. Repeat steps 1-18, but with problem X replaced by Conjecture C. (Again, the storyline may be different from 
that presented above.) This procedure itself may iterate a few times.
20. Finally, the problem has been boiled down to its most purified essence: a key conjecture K which (morally, 
at least) provides the decisive input into the known methods A^*, B^*, etc. which will settle conjecture C 
and hence problem X.
21. A breakthrough: a new method Z is introduced to solve an important special case of K.
22. The endgame: method Z is rapidly developed and extended, using the full power of all the intuition, experience, 
and past results, to fully settle K, then C, and then at last X.
23. The technology developed to solve major problem X is adapted to solve other related problems in the 
field. But now a natural successor question X’ to X arises, which lies just outside of the reach of the 
newly developed tools… and we go back to Step 1.
```

Greg Kuperberg stresses Terry’s point regarding “personal fallibility in the face of open problems”:

```markdown
If you think that you have solved an open problem, you should keep trying to understand it better for a 
while, because there is a good chance that you will find a mistake. This is still good advice even if it’s 
a run-of-the-mill open problem, not an incredibly hard open problem like Fermat’s Last Theorem.

Here is the sort of intuitive fallacy that can come up in a geometry argument: “If I lengthen all three 
sides of a triangle, its area will go up.” It sounds believable, and it even works in a few examples — but 
it’s not always true for obtuse triangles. Of course if you view this example in isolation, it seems 
boneheaded. But when working on an open problem, most people have to make intuitive leaps of this sort. If 
you think that you have a new result, that’s a great time to go back and debug your intuition at each step.

Terry also makes the more specific point that you should know the difference between climbing the mountain 
and marching around it. Restating a problem several times, or reducing it to another problem, is actually 
very good practice. But solving an open problem usually takes more than that. A few problems can be solved 
that way. Also, a few people have at times brilliantly transformed a broad set of problems by generalizing 
and restating them — this was Grothendieck’s work philosophy. But a more common outcome is that if you
restate a question too many times, eventually you will make it “easier” by restating it erroneously.

An example problem that can be solved almost entirely with restatement: Counting problems where the answer 
is the Catalan numbers, for example the number of lists of 2n balanced parentheses. However, this is only
medium-hard as counting problems go, and the restatements have to be somewhat clever to work.

An example where restatements are not known to work by themselves: Counting alternating-sign matrices, or 
ASMs. There are a dozen or so interesting-looking encodings of alternating-sign matrices. You can spend ages
rummaging through them in search of a simple counting principle to count ASMs. In fact, restatements of the
ASM problem have been important, for instance the description of ASMs in terms of square ice. But even the
important restatements do not solve this problem; rather they only give you access to substantive methods 
such as the Yang-Baxter equation.
```

(Tangent: I half-remember a discrete math HW assignment, a counting problem, regarding the number of lists of balanced parentheses. Puzzled for hours over that one until I thought of viewing it from (yet) another angle, after which it became much more tractable, if not exactly trivial. Point of view, as Alan Kay will tell you, is worth 80 IQ points; in this case the restatement I found was probably worth more like 10, but that was enough.)

Qiaochu asks:

```markdown
I’m quite curious – can you give an example where that process actually occurred, preferably multiple 
times? I’m not really aware of any resources for finding out the full story behind how a conjecture – 
especially not a particularly well-known, but still important, one – was proven, so I (and I hope others 
as well) would find such an example quite valuable.

Really the only good example I know of is the writeup of the Polymath project!
```

Terry’s response:

```markdown
Dear Qiaochu,

Actually most solutions to major problems (e.g. Poincare conjecture, Fermat’s last theorem, etc.) have 
this sort of history – a painstaking series of explorations, conjectures, setbacks, steady accumulation
of intuition and insights, realisation of the naivete of earlier approaches, etc. It is indeed difficult
though to find a coherent narrative for any given one of these problems (except perhaps at conference 
talks, or an advanced survey article); usually the story is spread throughout a dozen papers, and one has
to have a fair amount of familiarity with the problem to really appreciate the unfolding of progress.

For some problems, though, there are some good surveys that focus on exactly this sort of narrative, e.g.
Goldston-Pintz-Yildirim’s “The path to recent progress on small gaps between primes”. Milnor’s Clay article 
on the Poincare conjecture covers the topological phase of the attacks on that problem fairly well, and 
the important discovery of the geometrisation conjecture, though it is rather light on the Ricci flow approach 
which is of course at the heart of Perelman’s solution (but it is fair to say that this geometric approach 
would only have been seriously attempted after it became abundantly clear that the topological methods had 
fallen quite short of what was needed to settle the conjecture). Morgan’s BAMS survey article on the subject 
covers the latter quite thoroughly, though the focus is more on the technical details than on the development
of ideas. Finally, I discuss the narrative surrounding Szemeredi’s theorem in my article “What is good 
mathematics?” (linked to on the sidebar of this blog).

### Mathematical maturity
([overview](#overview))

From Redditor [man_after_midnight](https://www.reddit.com/user/man_after_midnight), answering Mathematicians of Reddit: [Is there some point where you see a big picture and everything "clicks"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1mtian/mathematicians_of_reddit_is_there_some_point/):

```markdown
The way it was described to me when I was in high school was in terms of 'levels'.

Sometimes, in your mathematics career, you find that your slow progress, and careful accumulation of tools 
and ideas, has suddenly allowed you to do a bunch of new things that you couldn't possibly do before. Even 
though you were learning things that were useless by themselves, when they've all become second nature, a 
whole new world of possibility appears. You have "leveled up", if you will. Something clicks, but now there 
are new challenges, and now, things you were barely able to think about before suddenly become critically 
important.

It's usually obvious when you're talking to somebody a level above you, because they see lots of things 
instantly when those things take considerable work for you to figure out. These are good people to learn 
from, because they remember what it's like to struggle in the place where you're struggling, but the things 
they do still make sense from your perspective (you just couldn't do them yourself).

Talking to somebody two or levels above you is a different story. They're barely speaking the same language, 
and it's almost impossible to imagine that you could ever know what they know. You can still learn from them, 
if you don't get discouraged, but the things they want to teach you seem really philosophical, and you don't 
think they'll help you—but for some reason, they do.

Somebody three levels above is actually speaking a different language. They probably seem less impressive to 
you than the person two levels above, because most of what they're thinking about is completely invisible to 
you. From where you are, it is not possible to imagine what they think about, or why. You might think you can, 
but this is only because they know how to tell entertaining stories. Any one of these stories probably contains 
enough wisdom to get you halfway to your next level if you put in enough time thinking about it.

What follows is my rough opinion on how this looks in a typical path towards a Ph.D. in math. Obviously this 
is rather subjective, and makes math look too linear, but I think it's a useful thought experiment.

Consider the change that a person undergoes in first mastering elementary algebra. Let's say that that's one 
level. This student is now comfortable with algebraic manipulation and the idea of variables.

The next level may come somewhere during a first calculus course. The student now understands the concept of 
the infinitely small, of slope at a point, and can reason about areas, physical motion, and optimization.

Many stop here, believing that they have finally learned math. Those who do not stop, might proceed through 
multivariable calculus and perhaps a basic linear algebra course with the tools they currently possess. Their 
next level comes when they find themselves suffering through an abstract algebra course, and have to once 
again reshape their whole thought process just to squeak by with a C.

Once this student masters all of that, the rest of the undergraduate curriculum at their university might be a 
breeze. But not so with graduate school. They gain a level their first year. They gain another their third year. 
And they are horrified to discover that they are expected to gain a third level before they graduate. This 
level is the hardest of them all, because it is the first one that consists in mastering material that has been 
created largely by the student.

I don't know how many levels there are after that. At least three.

So, the bad news is, you never do see the whole picture (though you see the old picture shrink down to a tiny 
point), and you can't really explain what you do see. But the good news is that the world of mathematics is so 
rich and exciting and wonderful that even your wildest dreams about it cannot possibly compare. It is not like 
seeing the Matrix—it is like seeing the Matrix within the Matrix within the Matrix within the Matrix within the
Matrix.
```

John Baez shared it on Google+ and [added](https://plus.google.com/+johncbaez999/posts/36g9jx54nni):

```markdown
As he points out, this talk of 'levels' is too linear. You can be much better at algebraic geometry than 
your friend, but way behind them in probability theory. Or even within a field like algebraic geometry, 
you might be able to understand sheaf cohomology better than your friend, yet still way behind in some 
classical topic like elliptic curves.

To have worthwhile conversations with someone who is not evenly matched with you in some subject, it's 
often good for one of you to play 'student' while the other plays 'teacher'. Playing teacher is an ego 
boost, and it helps organize your thoughts - but playing student is a great way to amass knowledge and 
practice humility... and a good student can help the teacher think about things in new ways.

Taking turns between who is teacher and who is student helps keep things from becoming unbalanced. And it's 
especially fun when some subject can only be understood with the combined knowledge of both players.

I have a feeling good mathematicians spend a lot of time playing these games - we often hear of famous 
teams like Atiyah, Bott and Singer, or even bigger ones like the French collective called 'Bourbaki'. For 
about a decade, I played teacher/student games with James Dolan, and it was really productive. I should 
probably find a new partner to learn the new kinds of math I'm working on now. Trying to learn things by 
yourself is a huge disadvantage if you want to quickly rise to higher 'levels'.
```

I also found Baez’s comment on how this relates to his experience ‘preaching’ category theory to ‘the masses’ interesting:

```markdown
To me category theory seems like a great branch of math for seeing how people climb up levels. Perhaps 
this because I've studied it a bunch and know a lot of people who think about it. But perhaps it's also 
because category theory is extremely conceptual, so lots of things of things seem obvious when you 
understand them, with no need for calculation to prove them - just a verbal argument will do - while the 
same verbal arguments seem cryptic and baffling before you understand them.

The point is that one needs to really understand the concepts used in these verbal arguments. One puts 
in a lot of sweat to understand them, but after one has, one can often use them with an ease that seems 
magical to people at lower levels. This is probably why lots of people get annoyed with category 
theorists, calling them 'too abstract'.

But it's also good to remember that category theory is just one portion of math, so people at a high 
level in category theory can still be embarrassingly clueless and awkward in other branches of math.
```

And to Toby Bartels’ suggestion that these ‘levels’ consist mostly of increasing abstraction:

```markdown
There are importantly different levels of competence in doing mathematics other than levels of 
abstraction: for example, levels of skill in devising proofs, levels of skill in inventing research 
program, and levels of understanding the 'big picture' of mathematics: what the big problems are and 
why they're interesting.

I often run into freshly-minted category theory postdocs who initially impress me with their ability 
to throw around (infinity,1)-categories, stacks, topoi and the like... but then amuse me because they 
don't know enough math to apply these concepts in powerful ways, or even understand where they fit into 
the grand scheme of things. They just haven't had time to learn the logic, algebra, topology, geometry, 
analysis, physics, and so on that these abstract concepts were designed to help us with. So they may 
seem superficially to be at a 'high level', but in a lot of ways they're not. (I don't think 'level' is 
quite the right word for what I mean, since it's too linear.)
```

Gary Ray R on how it pertains to engineering:

```markdown
I think the idea of levels also applies to Mechanical Engineering. I remember really having difficulty 
with Thermodynamics. I spent hours and hours on the homework, and never though I got any better, I was 
so happy with a B-. At the end of the course the instructor asked if I wanted to be his TA and grader 
for the next year. I was flummoxed, me, I just barely got this stuff. He said, you can do it. Well the 
next year I graded Thermo and that was one of the very hardest things in my engineering studies. But I 
jumped a level and did not really realize it.

Later when I went back for grad school in Materials Engineering, the Thermo seemed so easy, I was surprised 
at what I was so hard now seemed so clear. I could explain almost anything with Gibbs Free Energy, and 
the math was not that hard. But the concept took a while to sink in.
```

Ravi Vakil's [advice page](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html) for potential PhD students has some great quotes. The most memorable is this one:

```markdown
Here's a phenomenon I was surprised to find: you'll go to talks, and hear various words, whose 
definitions you're not so sure about. At some point you'll be able to make a sentence using those
words; you won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the sentence is correct. You'll also 
be able to ask a question using those words. You still won't know what the words mean, but you'll
know the question is interesting, and you'll want to know the answer. Then later on, you'll learn 
what the words mean more precisely, and your sense of how they fit together will make that learning
much easier. 

The reason for this phenomenon is that mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to 
learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll 
never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. 
Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier 
to do than learning "forwards". 

(Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and
to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel 
free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)

### Good mathematics
([overview](#overview))

From Terry Tao's paper [What is good mathematics?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0702396.pdf):

```markdown
There are many different types of mathematics which could be designated “good”. For instance, “good 
mathematics” could refer (in no particular order) to

(i) Good mathematical problem-solving (e.g. a major breakthrough on an important mathematical problem);
(ii) Good mathematical technique (e.g. a masterful use of existing methods, or the development of 
new tools);
(iii) Good mathematical theory (e.g. a conceptual framework or choice of notation which systematically 
unifies and generalises an existing body of results);
(iv) Good mathematical insight (e.g. a major conceptual simplification, or the realisation of a unifying
principle, heuristic, analogy, or theme);
(v) Good mathematical discovery (e.g. the revelation of an unexpected and intriguing new mathematical 
phenomenon, connection, or counterexample);
(vi) Good mathematical application (e.g. to important problems in physics, engineering, computer science,
statistics, etc., or from one field of mathematics to another);
(vii) Good mathematical exposition (e.g. a detailed and informative survey on a timely mathematical topic,
or a clear and well-motivated argument);
(viii) Good mathematical pedagogy (e.g. a lecture or writing style which enables others to learn and do
mathematics more effectively, or contributions to mathematical education);
(ix) Good mathematical vision (e.g. a long-range and fruitful program or set of conjectures);
(x) Good mathematical taste (e.g. a research goal which is inherently interesting and impacts important
topics, themes, or questions);
(xi) Good mathematical public relations (e.g. an effective showcasing of a mathematical achievement to 
non-mathematicians, or from one field of mathematics to another);
(xii) Good meta-mathematics (e.g. advances in the foundations, philosophy, history, scholarship, or
practice of mathematics);
(xiii) Rigorous mathematics (with all details correctly and carefully given in full);
(xiv) Beautiful mathematics (e.g. the amazing identities of Ramanujan; results which are easy (and pretty) 
to state but not to prove);
(xv) Elegant mathematics (e.g. Paul Erd˝os’ concept of “proofs from the Book”; achieving a difficult 
result with a minimum of effort);
(xvi) Creative mathematics (e.g. a radically new and original technique, viewpoint, or species of result);
(xvii) Useful mathematics (e.g. a lemma or method which will be used repeatedly in future work on the subject);
(xviii) Strong mathematics (e.g. a sharp result that matches the known counterexamples, or a result 
which deduces an unexpectedly strong conclusion from a seemingly weak hypothesis);
(xix) Deep mathematics (e.g. a result which is manifestly non-trivial, for instance by
capturing a subtle phenomenon beyond the reach of more elementary tools);
(xx) Intuitive mathematics (e.g. an argument which is natural and easily visualisable);
(xxi) Definitive mathematics (e.g. a classification of all objects of a certain type; the final word on
a mathematical topic); etc.

As the above list demonstrates, the concept of mathematical quality is a highdimensional one, and lacks an
obvious canonical total ordering. I believe this is because mathematics is itself complex and high-dimensional,
and evolves in unexpected and adaptive ways; each of the above qualities represents a different way in which we
as a community improve our understanding and usage of the subject. There does not appear to be universal
agreement as to the relative importance or weight of each of the above qualities. This is partly due to tactical
considerations: a field of mathematics at a given stage of development may be more receptive to one approach to 
mathematics than another. It is also partly due to cultural considerations: any given field or school of
mathematics tends to attract like-minded mathematicians who prefer similar approaches to a subject. It also 
reflects the diversity of mathematical ability; different mathematicians tend to excel in different mathematical 
styles, and are thus well suited for different types of mathematical challenges.
```

This multifaceted nature of "good math" is healthy for math as a whole, since desirable traits can be detrimental to a field if pursued at the expense of others, per the following (made up) scenarios:

```markdown
• A field which becomes increasingly ornate and baroque, in which individual
results are generalised and refined for their own sake, but the subject as a
whole drifts aimlessly without any definite direction or sense of progress;
• A field which becomes filled with many astounding conjectures, but with no
hope of rigorous progress on any of them;
• A field which now consists primarily of using ad hoc methods to solve a collection
of unrelated problems, which have no unifying theme, connections, or purpose;
• A field which has become overly dry and theoretical, continually recasting and
unifying previous results in increasingly technical formal frameworks, but not
generating any exciting new breakthroughs as a consequence; or
• A field which reveres classical results, and continually presents shorter, simpler,
and more elegant proofs of these results, but which does not generate any truly
original and new results beyond the classical literature.

### What every mathematician should know
([overview](#overview))

Timothy Chow is well worth reading. Here's his answer to the MO question [How has "what every mathematician should know" changed?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19356/how-has-what-every-mathematician-should-know-changed?rq=1):

```markdown
I believe that one shift is that "what every mathematician should know" is nowadays much less a 
specific body of mathematical facts and much more a facility with navigating the ocean of mathematical
knowledge.

For example, I might not need to have advanced computer programming skills, but I do need to have some
sense of what kinds of computations are feasible and when it is appropriate for me to do a computation.

I might not need to hold in my head everything that is known about a certain topic, even if that topic 
is close to my area of specialization, but I definitely need to have the ability to search the literature,
assess what is in a certain paper that my search turns up, and know when I should ask an expert and how 
to formulate a targeted question to ask.

Similarly, I might not need detailed knowledge of fields (seemingly) distant from my own, but I do need 
to be able to discern when those distant fields might provide relevant tools for my own work.

So far I have been focusing on what a mathematician needs to know in order to be an effective researcher.
However, the phrase "what every mathematician should know" carries overtones of what one should know if 
one wants to earn a reputation for being an educated, knowledgeable, respectable, and attractive 
representative of the profession. In my opinion this is quite a different question. For this, you need to
be fluent in the language of the hot topics du jour, and au courantwith flashy announcements of big
breakthroughs in all areas of mathematics. While there's some correlation between this kind of knowledge
and the knowledge I discussed above, I find it questionable whether, literally speaking, every 
mathematician should have it.
```

Here he echoes Barry Mazur, whose [writing on the subject](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/math_ed_2.pdf) is so beautiful and fulfilling I can't help but reproduce large parts of it wholesale here. 

Lingua franca, unifiers, ubiquitous:

```markdown
Certain fields of mathematics, at certain times, play the role of lingua franca in the sense that
mathematics from vastly different fields get formulated in the vocabulary, the terminology, or even 
more strikingly in the conceptual framework of that specific field. Weierstrass’s theory of functions,
Cantor’s Set Theory and Group Theory have played (and continue to play) such a role; the vocabulary 
of Category Theory has permeated disparate disciplines. These are some of the grand forces in mathematics
that shape our way of communicating to one another. Other fields formulate powerful viewpoints, templates,
that cross over to distant disciplines–let’s call these fields unifiers. Algebraic Topology has done 
service as a unifier, as has large aspects of Algebraic Geometry. Other fields are so ubiquitous that 
they cast light on all other disciplines of mathematics: measure theory, probability and statistics
come to mind; perhaps aspects of combinatorics.

In any epoch there will be the lingua franca, the unifiers and the ubiquitous of that epoch. A young
(or an old) mathematician, of no matter what specialty, would do well to be acquainted—at least a tiny
bit acquainted—with the mathematical goings-on in these fields. So which fields are of that sort these days?
```

Critical mass of learned info causing phase shift in POV of entire subject:

```markdown
Before offering a concrete list of good “fields of acquaintance” I want to convey an idea of a friend
of mine, who is a student of European History. He tells me that at one point in his career studying
European History, he experienced an abrupt phase shift. Once you’ve achieved—says my friend—a certain 
critical mass of historical information, all of a sudden your view of the entire subject changes. First,
your power of simply retaining information increases multifold; but more importantly, your way of thinking 
about the subject bears no relation to the way you approached things initially. My friend accounted for 
this surprising moment as a consequence of accumulation, perhaps to overload, of somehow-connected specifics
that forced him to involuntarily re-configure—in a more meaningful way— his modes of organization, and 
contemplation, of the entirety of this corpus of knowledge.

Well, it would be interesting if we could put our finger on the critical moments, the phase shifts—if they 
exist—in our mathematical education. If they do exist they may depend less on our having devoured any 
specific collection of mathematical ideas, and more on our having exposed ourselves to some un-specifiable
critical mass. With this in mind, I’ll end, below, with a list that nowadays, in my opinion, stands for 
“fields of acquaintance” any critical mass of them being a good choice for a good mathematical education.
```

A broad mathematical education should help a person achieve a predilection for the four (most classical, significantly overlapping) aspects of mathematical thought — Geometry, Algebra, Computation, and The mathematical intuition(s) derived from Physics — which aren’t the same as the traditional subject classifications, but rather should be thought of as highly developed ‘intuitions’:

```markdown
I say that these are “overlapping,’ but in reality, what makes mathematics one subject is that nothing 
that we do is entirely contained in one of these categories: they seem to stand for distinct intuitions,
and have given rise to distinct realms of thought, and yet they are inseparably welded together. These four
categories have been fused together so substantially in recent times that it may even be misleading to keep
bringing them up. For there are subjects of great importance such as the theory of modular (or automorphic) 
forms that defy this categorization completely, since they stretch their substance, their tools, and the 
intuition they rely on over all four of these items.

Nevertheless, Geometry, Algebra, Computation, and Mathematical Physics represent a recognizable, if wobbly, 
partition of mathematical sensibilities. Let us consider them as motivating intuitions rather than fixed 
repositories of knowledge; i.e., as fundamental types of highly developed senses that some mathematicians
enjoy: there are people with strong geometric intuitions; there are those with strong algebraic intuitions;
there are those who are very sensitive to various aspects of computation and estimation and then there are 
the lucky people who also bring into the mix some basic physical intuition. I also think that we all understand
what it means for some mathematician to have any one of these gifts—whether or not we ourselves possess it.

So, a broad mathematical education should, perhaps, aim to help a person achieve (at least somewhat) a 
predilection for each of these ways of thinking. I would like to view each of these intuitions as “core” 
rather than any particular conglomeration of subject matter as core.

In response to an earlier draft, David Mumford asked me where I would put the traditional, and grand, subject 
of Analysis in this classification, Analysis being a subject dealing with intuitions as fundamental as time, 
change, and continuity; my feeling is that the subject is so many-dimensional that it derives its inspiration
and intuitions from every, or any, direction: when you say that someone is a strong analyst, you might mean 
that this person has a keen sense of a priori estimates in PDE, which I would tag as computation and estimation;
or you might be talking of a good complex analyst dealing with dynamical systems which I would tag as geometry,
etc. I would probably want to spread Analysis over all four categories.
```

The four intuitions, “today’s list” per Mazur:

```markdown
• Geometry-in the broad sense: This can be experienced in so many different ways that any one person’s 
“critical mass” will be disjoint from another person’s. Our sense of geometry might go from knot theory
to differential geometry (and the related analysis; e.g., the spectrum of the Laplacian) to classification
of n-dimensional manifolds to symplectic geometry to dynamical systems to sphere-packing to fixed point
theorems to K-theory to systems of elliptic PDE’s in the large to the Index Theorem to Bott periodicity
to the homotopy groups of spheres. . . and here we would be moving into the more algebraic realms of 
algebraic topology, which nowadays is also commingling with algebraic geometry.

• Algebra-in the broad sense. This includes the ubiquitous notion of groups (say; finite, finitely presented,
Lie, algebraic, arithmetic, and adelic) and their linear and projective (finite- and infinite-dimensional)
representations. It includes elementary aspects of any of the subjects with “algebraic” as an adjective in
their name: algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and algebraic number theory. It includes the entire 
basic vocabulary of very general languages such as category theory and more specific languages of use in 
traditional functional analysis such as the theory of Hilbert and Banach spaces.

• Computation–in the broad sense. This stretches from machine computation, algorithms, numerical analysis, 
estimation, and statistics, to combinatorics, analysis and probability; i.e., ways of dealing with data,
practically and/or theoretically.

• Mathematics related to Physics. Newtonian Mechanics, Optics, Maxwell’s Equations, Relativity, some Quantum
Mechanics and some physics related to field theories and string theory; and—of course—the mathematics that 
connects to this.

### Go to seminars
([overview](#overview))

Ravi Vakil's [advice page](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html) for potential PhD students has loads of advice related to going to seminars:

```markdown
Older graduate students will verify that there is a high correlation between those students who 
are doing the broadest and deepest work and those who are regularly attending seminars. Many
people erroneously conclude that those who are the strongest students therefore go to seminars, 
while in fact the causation goes very much in the opposite direction.

Go to research seminars earlier than you think you should. Do not just go to seminars that you 
think are directly related to what you do (or more precisely, what you currently think you 
currently do). You should certainly go to every single seminar related to algebraic geometry that
you can, and likely drop by other seminars occasionally too. Learning to get information out of
research seminars is an acquired skill, usually acquired much later than the skill of reading 
mathematics. You may think it isn't helpful to go to a seminar where you understand just 5% of
what the speaker says, and may want to wait until you are closer to 100%; but no one is anywhere
near 100% (even the speaker!), so you should go anyway.

Try to follow the thread of the talk, and when you get thrown, try to get back on again. (This
isn't always possible, and admittedly often the fault lies with the speaker.)

At the end of the talk, you should try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker
trying to answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the speaker proved?
Do I have a small example of the phenonenon under discussion? You can even scribble down these 
questions at the start of the talk, and jot down answers to them during the talk.

Try to extract three words from the talk (no matter how tangentially related to the subject at 
hand) that you want to know the definition of. Then after the talk, ask me what they mean. (In 
general, feel free to touch base with me after every seminar. I might tell you something 
interesting related to the talk.)

See if you can get one lesson from the talk (broadly interpreted). If you manage to get one lesson
from each talk you go to, you'll learn a huge amount over time, although you'll only realize this 
after quite a while. (If you are unable to learn even one thing about mathematics from a talk,
think about what the speaker could have done differently so that you could have learned something.
You can learn a lot about giving good talks by thinking about what makes bad talks bad.)

Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during the talk, or privately
afterwards. The act of trying to formulating an interesting question (for you, not the speaker!)
is a worthwhile exercise, and can focus the mind.

Your thesis problem may well come out of an idea you have while sitting in a seminar.

Go to seminar dinners when at all possible, even though it is scary, and no one else is going.

Go to colloquia fairly often, so you have a reasonable idea of what is happening in other parts 
of mathematics. It is amazing what can become relevant to your research. You won't believe it 
until it happens to you. And it won't happen to you unless you go to colloquia. Ditto for seminars
in other fields.
```

Vakil expands upon one of the points above in this page: [The "Three Things" Exercise for getting things out of talks](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html):

```markdown
*The challenge of talks*. It is tricky to get things out of talks, even after a lot of practice. 
It is very easy to go to a talk, and at some point have your eyes glaze over. Talks are like horses:
once you are thrown off, it is hard to get back on. Especially if the horse is stomping on your face.
(That's why it is very bad to come into a talk a few minutes late --- even if it is sometimes
necessary.)

"Three Things" is an exercise to learn how to get things out of talks. It can be useful if you are in
the first few years of going to seminars --- I've intended it as practice for graduate students --- 
but I've also found that I got much more out of talks (especially those out of my comfort zone) when
using it. It is admittedly a little contrived, and when a bunch of us first experimented with it 
(perhaps around 2007?), we stopped doing it after a while because we got tired of it.

*The theory is as follows*. If you can get even three small things out of a talk, it is a successful
talk. And if you can't get even three small things out of a talk, it was not a successful experience.
Note that the things you get out of a talk needn't be the things that your neighbor got out of a talk,
or the things the speaker expected you to get out of the talk.

*Here is how it works*. Take a clean sheet of paper, or an index card. Your goal is to have three things,
and only three things, on this sheet at the end of the talk. The "things" can be of many forms:

- a definition you want to remember (e.g. "a K3 surface is...")
- a theorem you want to remember ("the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces is smooth")
- a motivating or key example ("a quartic is an example of a K3 surface")
- a motivating problem ("why are all moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces the same dimension?")
- a question you want to ask the speaker ("why is that hypothesis in your theorem?")
- a question you want to ask someone else (a definition, motivation, a question about a connection etc.)
- anything else of a similar flavor: something specific that made you think. Something vague ("I liked 
the part where she talked about groups") does not count as a "thing".

*As you watch the talk*, look out for "things" you like. When one comes your way, write it down. Then
later write down a second. Then write down a third. Hopefully a fourth will come your way --- and
then you must look over the previous three, and decide which one must be cut. A dirty secret is that
you may not be able to prevent yourself from remembering the one you cut --- and the ones you kept
and reviewed will be more fixed in your mind.

(If you take notes in a more traditional sense, you can still play the game, by putting a star beside
each "thing". This works a little less well; you will be less focused on looking for "things".)

*After the talk*: if other people are playing, send each other your things by email (or discuss them
in person). It is surprisingly enlightening. And there will likely be some follow-up discussion. It
doesn't take much time (to type or to send one sentence responses to others' things if the spirit 
moves you). If you have questions, then ask them to someone (perhaps the speaker over the semianr
dinner; or perhaps your advisor or your students or your colleagues). Don't let them drop.

### Asking the right question
([overview](#overview))

[Jay Daigle](https://jaydaigle.net/) is an assistant professor of math at Occidental College who received his PhD in number theory at Caltech under Matthias Flach. He’s also jadagul of [Maybe-Mathematical Musings](http://jadagul.tumblr.com/), one of the two really consistently high-quality math-content-producers/commentators I’ve had the pleasure of stumbling across on math Tumblr (the other being Rob Nostalgebraist, who also writes [genuinely great fiction](https://archiveofourown.org/users/nostalgebraist/pseuds/nostalgebraist) and is a [brilliant book reviewer](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13933106.nostalgebraist)). He’s sufficiently [differently free from me](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/11/05/dont-surround-yourself-with-smarter-people/) in Venkat Rao’s sense, plus just flat-out smarter, that I always get a lot out of his writings in Alan Kay’s “point of view is worth 80 IQ points” sense, so I always enjoy reading his math #effortposts.

Recently I discovered that he’s collected these effortposts into a standalone blog, [Jay's Blog](https://jaydaigle.net/blog/paradigms-and-priors/), so I’ve had a lot of fun going over his essays. Here are some quotes from one of those essays, [Asking the Right Question](https://jaydaigle.net/blog/asking-the-right-question/), which I’m saving here for quick future reference. (You should Jay’s original essay instead of defaulting to my quotes below! He’s a really enjoyable read, I promise.)

First off: why is asking good questions so important? About four reasons, the last one being the main thrust of this section:

```markdown
First and most obviously, it’s easier to get help with things and learn things if you can ask better
questions. 

Second, and maybe more importantly, framing questions well is a lot of what makes you a good 
mathematician.

The most boring way to ask a bad question is just to not include enough information. Sometimes this
is just laziness (“I don’t understand how to do this problem, please help”). And I’ve definitely seen 
questions asked that are thin disguises over “I don’t want to do my homework; can someone do it for me?”

But more often, badly-phrased questions result from deep confusion on the part of the asker. If they 
understood the material well enough to ask their question clearly and correctly, they wouldn’t need to
ask it in the first place.
```

It's important to be able to figure out what question to ask in the first place:

```markdown
A lot of math is less about answering questions than about figuring out exactly what question you should
be asking, and how to make it precise. We tend to sweep this under the rug a bit when teaching, in a way 
that I suspect probably leads to a certain amount of confusion.

When we teach, we often ask a question, and then demonstrate a tool to answer it, without necessarily 
stopping to explain why that question is a good one, or how people settled on asking exactly that question.
And this often leaves our students with the sense that what they’re doing doesn’t really mean anything.

This is a major reason students fall back on figuring out what “type of problem” they’re working on, and
then following “the steps” to get the answer. They see math as a sort of opaque box, and a question asks
them to perform the correct magical ritual to get the answer. Because if the words you’re using—and your
questions—don’t have a meaning, that’s all you can really do.

And that’s how you get questions like “how do I find solutions to f(x) = sin(x)+1/2.” I can tell what the
original question probably was. But because the student doesn’t really understand what a “function” is, 
they ask a question that is, read literally, completely nonsensical.
```

An example of a badly-written but actually great question:

```markdown
Sometimes, you see a question that’s basically “this one thing feels kind of like this other thing, but 
I can’t tell you how. Can you tell me?”

These people are doing good math. They’re noticing a pattern, and trying to put it into words. They’re 
maybe not quite there, and sometimes it’s hard to answer the question clearly. But it shows great
instincts.

And this is how math tends to actually get done! When we teach, we tend to define terms, then state 
theorems about them, and then prove the theorems. But this is exactly backwards from how math is often
actually done. First we understand what’s going on; then we figure out what the rule is and write it 
down; and finally understand what conditions are important and give those conditions names. That is, 
we formulate a proof, then state the theorem, and then define the terms.

These questions are working on step 1. I want to encourage them.

### Why math is boring
([overview](#overview))

From John Baez's "very rough draft" [Why Mathematics is Boring](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/boring.pdf), where he argues in the abstract that the boring style of math publications is a serious matter to contend with:

```markdown
Storytellers have many strategies for luring in their audience and keeping them interested.
These include standardized narrative structures, vivid characters, breaking down long stories
into episodes, and subtle methods of reminding the readers of facts they may have forgotten. The
typical style of writing mathematics systematically avoids these strategies, since the explicit goal
is “proving a fact” rather than “telling a story”. Readers are left to provide their own narrative
framework, which they do privately, in conversations, or in colloquium talks. As a result, even
expert mathematicians find papers — especially those outside their own field — boring and
difficult to understand. This impedes the development of mathematics.
```

Introduction:

```markdown
In their research papers, mathematicians usually eschew narrative techniques designed to keep readers
interested, since their main goal is not to “entertain” or even explain, but present logical arguments
as efficiently as possible. While this makes a certain sense, it neglects the human dimension
of mathematics. It neglects the fact that a piece of mathematics is almost useless if almost nobody
understands it. But, before anyone can understand a piece of mathematics, they must first become
interested in it. So, for a mathematician who wants to fully develop a piece of mathematics, discovery
and proof are only the first steps on a longer road. The next step is getting people interested.

Unfortunately, mathematicians are not trained in this art. Indeed, their writing is famous for
being “dry”. There are exceptions, and these exceptions are worth studying. But it also makes sense
to look to people whose whole business is getting people interested: story-tellers.
Everyone enjoys a good story. We have been telling and listening to stories for untold millennia.
Stories are one of our basic ways of understanding the world. I believe that when we read a piece of
mathematics, part of us is reading it as a highly refined and sublimated sort of story, with characters
and a plot, conflict and resolution.

If this is true, maybe we should consider some tips for short story writers, and see how they can
be applied — in transmuted form — to the writing of mathematics. These tips may sound a bit
crass to mathematicians, or even readers of “serious” fiction. But they go straight to the heart of
what gets people interested, and what keeps them interested, in a piece of writing.
```

Under "write a catchy first paragraph":

```markdown
We are constantly encountering texts; we don’t bother reading all the way through most of them.
Once texts were rare and precious. Now, in the era of the world-wide web, there is always too much
to read. We must efficiently cull out most of the material vying for our attention. Often we base
our decision on the first sentence or two.

Since most writers of short stories succeed largely on their sheer number of readers, and few
people read stories because they need to, writers of short stories learn the importance of quickly
grabbing the reader’s attention. In a catchy story, each sentence makes the reader want to read the
next. The first few sentences bear the brunt of this responsibility.

Mathematicians operate in a more forgiving environment, with guaranteed permanent employment for many. 
They can succeed with only few people reading their work. Consider two of the 
most famous mathematicians of recent years: Andrew Wiles and Grigori Perelman. How many of us
   have really read Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s last theorem, or Perelman’s sketched proof of the Poincar´e
conjecture? Even among professional mathematicians, most are satisfied to know that a few experts
vouch for these proofs’ validity. So, instead of broadening their readership, mathematicians are
mostly concerned with impressing other experts in their field.

So how might we do better? 

From Terry Tao's [Write in your own voice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/write-in-your-own-voice/):

```markdown
When one is not simply quoting the prior text for historical or archival purposes, it is best to 
paraphrase and interpret the previous text rather than to copy that text verbatim.  This is for a 
number of reasons:

- One wants to avoid conveying any impression to readers, referees, or editors of plagiarism, padding,
or intellectual laziness in one’s papers.  (Note that the latter is a danger even if one is copying 
from one’s own work, rather than that of others.)

- The prior work may be dated in view of more recent developments and insights, as mentioned above.

- If you are copying or adapted a piece of text from another author that you do not fully understand
yourself, then it may end up being inappropriate or incongruous for your intended purpose, and may 
convey the impression of superficiality or being ill-informed.  If the text becomes inaccurate due 
to this adaptation, then this can also cause some embarrassment and annoyance for the original author
of that text.

- Excessive use of quotation from famous mathematicians to make one’s own work look more impressive is
the mathematical equivalent of name-dropping, and should be avoided.  Appeal to authority should not be
the primary basis for motivating a paper; a handful of citations to demonstrate the depth of interest 
in the problem being studied is usually sufficient.

- But most importantly of all, for one’s further mathematical development and career, one needs to
develop one’s own consistent mathematical “voice” and style, and to avoid the impression of simply 
imitating the voices of other authors.  There is no need in this subject for the mathematical equivalent
of a parrot, and a text which is a mix of the author’s voice and the voice of others can read very 
strangely.
```

Terry advises strongly *against* imitating an author's style:

```markdown
In some cases, the imitation of a previous author’s style and text is intended as a sign of respect or 
flattery for that author.  This is misguided; an author will in fact often find such mimicry to actually 
be somewhat offensive.  If one wants to truly respect a mathematician, then understand that
mathematician’s methods, results, and exposition, and improve, update, adapt, and advance all three.  
Even the greatest mathematician’s contributions should advance with the field, rather than being 
worshipped and preserved in some supposed state of perfection; the latter is mostly suitable only for 
historical purposes.
```

Contrast [Scott Alexander's comment on Luke's *Rhetoric* post](#nonfiction) (it's a long section, so I'll quote only the relevant bit):

```markdown
Your role models here should be those vampires who hunt down the talented, suck out their souls, and absorb
their powers. Which writers' souls you feast upon depends on your own natural style and your goals. I've
gained most from reading Eliezer, Mencius Moldbug, Aleister Crowley, and G.K. Chesterton; I'm currently making
my way through Chesterton's collected works pretty much with the sole aim of imprinting his writing style into 
my brain.

Stepping from the sublime to the ridiculous, I took a lot from reading Dave Barry when I was a child. He 
has a very observational sense of humor, the sort where instead of going out looking for jokes, he just
writes about a topic and it ends up funny. It's not hard to copy if you're familiar enough with it. And
if you can be funny, people will read you whether you have any other redeeming qualities or not.

Getting imprinted with good writers like this will serve you for your entire life. It will serve you 
whether you're on your fiftieth draft of a thesis paper, or you're rushing a Less Wrong comment in
the three minutes before you have to go to work. It will even serve you in regular old non-written
conversation, because wit and clarity are independent of medium.
```

More general advice by Terry on writing papers (all go to links for further reading):

```markdown
- Use the introduction to “sell” the key points of your paper; the results should be described accurately.
One should also invest some effort in both organising and motivating the paper, and in particular in 
selecting good notation and giving appropriate amounts of detail. But one should not over-optimise the paper.
It also assists readability if you factor the paper into smaller pieces, for instance by making plenty 
of lemmas.

- To reduce the time needed to write and organise a paper, I recommend writing a rapid prototype first.

- For first time authors especially, it is important to try to write professionally, and in one’s own voice.
One should take advantage of the English language, and not just rely purely on mathematical symbols.

- The ratio between results and effort in one’s paper should be at a local maximum.
```

More on [creating lemmas](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/create-lemmas/) to factor the paper into smaller pieces to aid readability -- this is similar to [information hiding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding) in software engineering, or [structured programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) and [modularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_%28programming%29):

```markdown
A typical argument in modern mathematics is often quite intricate, requiring many different steps, 
ingredients, and notation. The authors of the argument, having been intimately involved in all aspects 
of its construction, often do not realise just how complicated such an argument appears to a reader who 
is encountering it for the first time (I myself have been guilty of this oversight).

Part of the reason for this is that there is plenty of implicit structure in a paper which is crucial 
to understanding it properly, and which is known to the authors, but is not readily apparent to the
readers. Suppose for instance that part of a paper goes like this:

…
In Section 2, facts A, B, and C are derived, and then used to deduce D.
In Section 3, D is used to derive E.
In Section 4, D, and another fact F, are used to derive G.
In Section 5, E, G, and another fact H, are used to derive I.
…

A reader who is going through this paper one section at a time will try to keep A, B, C, and D all in
mind after finishing Section 2, and moving on to later sections.  However, facts A, B, and C are never
used again; they were instrumental to the argument because they allowed one to establish D, but once D 
is established, A, B, and C can be safely forgotten. Note, though that the reader does not know this. 
As a consequence, while reading Sections 3, 4, and 5, the reader has to set aside some of his or her 
mental resources to retain some facts which are of no further use, thus obscuring the structure of the
argument and making it more difficult to follow.

Now one could address this by placing some remarks at the end of Section 2 along the lines of “Facts A,
B, and C will not be used again in the rest of the paper”, or by devoting more thought to organising 
and motivating the paper. These are all worthwhile things to do, but a much more elegant solution is
simply to encapsulate D as a lemma, and to place A, B, C inside the proof of that lemma. 

This conveys several useful structural cues to the reader: firstly, that D is likely to be an important 
fact to use in later parts of the argument, and secondly, that A, B, and C are not needed elsewhere in 
the paper and can be safely forgotten. This additional structure will be useful to all readers, but will
be especially appreciated by those readers who are already expert in how to prove facts such as D, since
they can then glance at the statement of the lemma, readily convince themselves that the lemma is plausible
(possibly by using other tools than A, B, and C), and then quickly move on to the next part of the argument.
One can also add some remarks “for the experts” after the proof of a lemma, discussing possible alternate
proofs, refinements, special cases, connections to other lemmas in the literature, etc.

We have seen how “folding” the argument into lemmas can reduce the complexity of that argument by
“localising” certain facts in the argument. The same method can also be used to localise notation, e.g. some
special-purpose notation used to prove D but is not used elsewhere in the paper. The design philosophy here 
is similar to that of information hiding in software engineering. (Other relevant software engineering 
philosophies for mathematical writing include structured programming and modularity.)

Lemmas also provide a good opportunity to explicitly “recap” all the running hypotheses, assumptions, and
notational conventions that have already been introduced in the argument, which can be invaluable to a
reader who has misunderstood or forgotten about part of this implied context. (Sometimes, such a recap would
be tediously long, in which case a sentence such as “Let the notation and assumptions be as above” may 
suffice. When these situations occur, one might wish to formalise all the running assumptions by judiciously
introducing some good notation.)

In some cases, the conclusion of the lemma may only need a portion of these hypotheses; this might be worth 
stating explicitly within the statement of the lemma, as it can clarify the nature of that lemma, and may 
also make it more useful for future applications.

One should write the statement of a lemma in a way that makes it easy to use, rather than easy to prove. 
Thus, one should try to make the hypotheses of the lemma natural and easy to verify, and the conclusions
of the lemma manifestly useful. Basically, the idea is to push as much of the details of the argument 
into the lemma as one can, to make the rest of the argument as simple as possible. Also, it may end up 
that you (or someone else) will eventually find a simpler proof of that lemma, thus reducing the net
complexity of the paper markedly (cf. the object-oriented approach to software engineering).

Folding the argument into lemmas also makes it easier to write a rapid prototype, as once one finalises 
the statement of the lemma, one can defer the proof of the lemma until later.

In summary, it’s almost always a good idea to have plenty of lemmas (and propositions and corollaries too,
of course) in an argument; it makes the overall structure of the argument more apparent, it makes the 
argument easier to follow, and can also provide some useful tools for future work in the area.
```

More on [avoiding premature optimization](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/dont-overoptimise/) -- see also [the same in computer science](#premature-optimization) and [readability in writing](#readability):

```markdown
here is a danger in being too perfectionist, and in trying to make every part of a paper as “optimal” 
as possible. After all the “easy” improvements have been made to a paper, one encounters a law of 
diminishing returns, in which any further improvements either require large amounts of time and effort,
or else require some tradeoffs in other qualities of the paper.

For instance, suppose one has a serviceable lemma that suffices for the task of proving the main
theorems of the paper at hand. One can then try to “optimise” this lemma by making the hypotheses weaker
and the conclusion stronger, but this can come at the cost of lengthening the proof of the lemma, and 
obscuring exactly how the lemma fits in with the rest of the paper. In the reverse direction, one could
also “optimise” the same lemma by replacing it with a weaker (but easier to prove) statement which still
barely suffices to prove the main theorem, but is now unsuitable for use in any later application. Thus
one encounters a tradeoff when one tries to improve the lemma in one direction or another. (In this case,
one resolution to this tradeoff is to have one formulation of the lemma stated and proved, and then add 
a remark about the other formulation, i.e. state the strong version and remark that we only use a special
case, or state the weak version and remark that stronger versions are possible.)

Carefully optimising results and notations in the hope that this will help future researchers in the 
field is a little risky; later authors may introduce new insights or new tools which render these 
painstakingly optimised results obsolete. The only time when this is really profitable is when you already 
know of a subsequent paper (perhaps a sequel to the one you are already writing) which will indeed rely
heavily on these results and notations, or when the current paper is clearly going to be the definitive 
paper in the subject for a long while.

If you haven’t already written a rapid prototype for your paper, then optimising a lemma may in fact be a 
complete waste of time, because you may find later on in the writing process that the lemma will need to
be modified anyway to deal with an unforeseen glitch in the original argument, or to improve the overall 
organisation of the paper.

I have sometimes seen authors try to optimise the length of the paper at the expense of all other
attributes, in the mistaken belief that brevity is equivalent to simplicity. While it can be that shorter
papers are simpler than longer ones, this is generally only true if the shortness of the paper was
achieved naturally rather than artificially. If brevity was attained by removing all examples, remarks,
whitespace, motivation, and discussion, or by striking out “redundant” English phrases and relying purely
on mathematical abbreviations (e.g. \forall instead of “For all”, etc.) and various ungrammatical
contractions, then this is generally a poor tradeoff; somewhat ironically, a paper which has been 
overcompressed may be viewed by readers as being more difficult to read than a longer, gentler, and more 
leisurely treatment of the same material. (See also “Give appropriate amounts of detail.”)

On the other hand, optimising the readability of the paper is always a good thing (except when it is at
the expense of rigour or accuracy), and the effort put into doing so is appreciated by readers.
```

More on [Maximising the results-to-effort ratio](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/maximising-the-results-to-effort-ratio/):

```markdown
As a professional courtesy, research papers in mathematics should be at a “local maximum” with respect
to the results-to-effort ratio: any “cheap” consequences, generalisations, variants, illustrative
counterexamples, etc. of one’s main results should be put into the paper if this can be done with only
moderate effort on the author’s part.  If one is too lazy to do this, these consequences might not 
appear in the literature for some time (as they are too close to your own paper to be separately
publishable in their own right), and each reader may have to rederive them by himself or herself, which
is a much less efficient process in the long run.

Conversely, if a huge fraction of the paper is devoted to only a minor extension of the main results,
one may consider removing that section, or replacing it by a sketch or even just a remark; it may be 
that a subsequent paper is able to achieve that result with much less effort anyway.

### *Levels of Organization in General Intelligence*
([overview](#overview))

Here are some interesting passages from Eliezer Yudkowsky’s paper [Levels of Organization in General Intelligence](https://intelligence.org/files/LOGI.pdf).

On the what and why of intelligence:

```markdown
Intelligence is an evolutionary advantage because it enables us to model, predict, and manipulate reality. 
Evolutionary problems are not limited to stereotypical ancestral contexts such as fleeing lions or chipping 
spears; our intelligence includes the ability to model social realities consisting of other humans, and the 
ability to predict and manipulate the internal reality of the mind.

Philosophers of the mind sometimes define “knowledge” as cognitive patterns that map to external reality 
(Newell 1980), but a surface mapping has no inherent evolutionary utility. Intelligence requires more than 
passive correspondence between internal representations and sensory data, or between sensory data and reality. 
Cognition goes beyond passive denotation; it can predict future sensory data from past experience. Intelligence 
requires correspondences strong enough for the organism to choose between futures by choosing actions on the 
basis of their future results.

Intelligence in the fully human sense requires the ability to manipulate the world by reasoning backward from a 
mental image of the desired outcome to create a mental image of the necessary actions. (In Section 2, these 
ascending tests of ability are formalized as sensory, predictive, decisive, and manipulative bindings between a 
model and a referent.)
```

For more on the evolution of intelligence in LOGI see [here](#evolution).

On AI being “not like” physics:

```markdown
I am admittedly biased against the search for a “single essence” of intelligence; I believe that the search for 
a single essence of intelligence lies at the center of AI’s previous failures. Simplicity is the grail of physics, 
not AI. Physicists win Nobel Prizes when they discover a previously unknown underlying layer and explain its 
behaviors. We already know what the ultimate bottom layer of an Artificial Intelligence looks like; it looks like 
ones and zeroes. Our job is to build something interesting out of those ones and zeroes. The Turing formalism does 
not solve this problem any more than quantum electrodynamics tells us how to build a bicycle; knowing the abstract 
fact that a bicycle is built from atoms doesn’t tell you how to build a bicycle out of atoms—which atoms to use and 
where to put them. Similarly, the abstract knowledge that biological neurons implement human intelligence does not 
explain human intelligence. The classical hype of early neural networks, that they used “the same parallel 
architecture as the human brain,” should, at most, have been a claim of using the same parallel architecture as an 
earthworm’s brain. (And given the complexity of biological neurons, the claim would still have been wrong.)
```

Or as Tooby and Cosmides (1992) put it:

```markdown
The science of understanding living organization is very different from physics or chemistry, where parsimony makes 
sense as a theoretical criterion. The study of organisms is more like reverse engineering, where one may be dealing 
with a large array of very different components whose heterogenous organization is explained by the way in which 
they interact to produce a functional outcome. Evolution, the constructor of living organisms, has no privileged 
tendency to build into designs principles of operation that are simple and general.
```

Here’s the more obvious kind of “physics envy” in AI:

```markdown
The field of Artificial Intelligence suffers from a heavy, lingering dose of genericity and black-box, blank-slate, 
tabula-rasa concepts seeping in from the Standard Social Sciences Model (SSSM) identified by Tooby and Cosmides 
(1992). The general project of liberating AI from the clutches of the SSSM is more work than I wish to undertake in 
this paper, but one problem that must be dealt with immediately is physics envy. The development of physics over the 
last few centuries has been characterized by the discovery of unifying equations which neatly underlie many complex 
phenomena. Most of the past fifty years in AI might be described as the search for a similar unifying principle 
believed to underlie the complex phenomenon of intelligence.

Physics envy in AI is the search for a single, simple underlying process, with the expectation that this one discovery 
will lay bare all the secrets of intelligence. The tendency to treat new approaches to AI as if they were new theories 
of physics may at least partially explain AI’s past history of overpromise and oversimplification. Attributing all 
the vast functionality of human intelligence to some single descriptive facet—that brains are “parallel,” or 
“distributed,” or “stochastic”; that minds use “deduction” or “induction”— results in a failure (an overhyped failure) 
as the project promises that all the functionality of human intelligence will slide out from some simple principle.
```

And here’s the more subtle one:

```markdown
The effects of physics envy can be more subtle; they also appear in the lack of interaction between AI projects. 
Physics envy has given rise to a series of AI projects that could only use one idea, as each new hypothesis for 
the one true essence of intelligence was tested and discarded.

Douglas Lenat’s AM and Eurisko programs (Lenat 1983)—though the results were controversial and may have been mildly 
exaggerated (Ritchie and Hanna 1984)—used nonetheless very intriguing and fundamental design patterns to deliver 
significant and unprecedented results. Despite this, the design patterns of Eurisko, such as self-modifying 
decomposable heuristics, have seen almost no reuse in later AIs. Even Lenat’s subsequent Cyc project (Lenat, Prakash, 
and Shepherd 1985) apparently does not reuse the ideas developed in Eurisko.

From the perspective of a modern-day programmer, accustomed to hoarding design patterns and code libraries, the 
lack of crossfertilization is a surprising anomaly. One would think that self-optimizing heuristics would be useful 
as an external tool, e.g. for parameter tuning, even if the overall cognitive architecture did not allow for the 
internal use of such heuristics.
```

A related point:

```markdown
Leaving out key design elements, without replacement, on the basis of the mistaken belief that they are not 
relevant to general intelligence, is an error that displays a terrifying synergy with “physics envy.” In extreme 
cases—and most historical cases have been extreme—the design ignores everything about the human mind except one 
characteristic (logic, distributed parallelism, fuzziness, etc.), which is held to be “the key to intelligence.” 
(On my more pessimistic days I sometimes wonder if successive fads are the only means by which knowledge of a 
given feature of human intelligence becomes widespread in AI.)
```

On the importance of emphasizing (the right kind of) “supersystem design” in developing general intelligence:

```markdown
I argue strongly for “supersystems,” but I do not believe that “supersystems” are the necessary and sufficient 
Key to AI. General intelligence requires the right supersystem, with the right cognitive subsystems, doing the 
right things in the right way. Humans are not intelligent by virtue of being “supersystems,” but by virtue of 
being a particular supersystem which implements human intelligence. I emphasize supersystem design because I 
believe that the field of AI has been crippled by the wrong kind of simplicity—a simplicity which, as a design 
constraint, rules out workable designs for intelligence; a simplicity which, as a methodology, rules out 
incremental progress toward an understanding of general intelligence; a simplicity which, as a viewpoint, renders 
most of the mind invisible except for whichever single aspect is currently promoted as the Key to AI.
```

On the need to focus on, not design simplicity, but “sufficiently complex explanations” and “usefully deep designs”:

```markdown
If the quest for design simplicity is to be “considered harmful,” what should replace it? I believe that rather 
than simplicity, we should pursue sufficiently complex explanations and usefully deep designs. In ordinary 
programming, there is no reason to assume a priori that the task is enormously large. In AI the rule should be 
that the problem is always harder and deeper than it looks, even after you take this rule into account.

Knowing that the task is large does not enable us to meet the challenge just by making our designs larger or more 
complicated; certain specific complexity is required, and complexity for the sake of complexity is worse than 
useless. Nonetheless, the presumption that we are more likely to underdesign than overdesign implies a different 
attitude towards design, in which victory is never declared, and even after a problem appears to be solved, we go 
on trying to solve it.

If this creed were to be summed up in a single phrase, it would be: “Necessary but not sufficient.” In accordance 
with this creed, it should be emphasized that supersystems thinking is only one part of a larger paradigm, and that 
an open-ended design process is itself “necessary but not sufficient.” These are first steps toward AI, but not 
the only first steps, and certainly not the last steps.
```

On his candidate for “the most debilitating mistake in AI”:

```markdown
If I had to pick one single mistake that has been the most debilitating in AI, it would be implementing a process 
too close to the token level—trying to implement a high-level process without implementing the underlying layers 
of organization. Many proverbial AI pathologies result at least partially from omitting lower levels of 
organization from the design.

Take, for example, that version of the “frame problem”—sometimes also considered a form of the “commonsense 
problem”—in which intelligent reasoning appears to require knowledge of an infinite number of special cases. 
Consider a CPU which adds two 32-bit numbers. The higher level consists of two integers which are added to produce 
a third integer. On a lower level, the computational objects are not regarded as opaque “integers,” but as ordered 
structures of 32 bits. When the CPU performs an arithmetic operation, two structures of 32 bits collide, under 
certain rules which govern the local interactions between bits, and the result is a new structure of 32 bits. Now 
consider the woes of a research team, with no knowledge of the CPU’s underlying implementation, that tries to 
create an arithmetic “expert system” by encoding a vast semantic network containing the “knowledge” that two and 
two make four, twenty-one and sixteen make thirty-seven, and so on. This giant lookup table requires eighteen 
billion billion entries for completion. 

In this hypothetical world where the lower-level process of addition is not 
understood, we can imagine the “common-sense” problem for addition; the launching of distributed Internet projects 
to “encode all the detailed knowledge necessary for addition”; the frame problem for addition; the philosophies of 
formal semantics under which the LISP token thirty-seven is meaningful because it refers to thirty-seven objects in 
the external world; the design principle that the token thirty-seven has no internal complexity and is rather given 
meaning by its network of relations to other tokens; the “number grounding problem”; the hopeful futurists arguing 
that past projects to create Artificial Addition failed because of inadequate computing power; and so on.

On the difference between human-written programs and computation in neurons:

```markdown
Another class of problem stems from “porting” across the extremely different programming styles of evolution 
versus human coding. Human-written programs typically involve a long series of chained dependencies that intersect 
at single points of failure— “crystalline” is a good term to describe most human code. Computation in neurons 
has a different character. Over time our pictures of biological neurons have evolved from simple integrators of 
synaptic inputs that fire when a threshold input level is reached, to sophisticated biological processors with 
mixed analog-digital logics, adaptive plasticity, dendritic computing, and functionally relevant dendritic and 
synaptic morphologies (Koch and Segev 2000). What remains true is that, from an algorithmic perspective, neural 
computing uses roughly arithmetical operations14 that proceed along multiple intertwining channels in which 
information is represented redundantly and processed stochastically. Hence, it is easier to “train” neural 
networks—even nonbiological connectionist networks—than to train a piece of human-written code. Flipping a random 
bit inside the state of a running program, or flipping a random bit in an assembly-language instruction, has a 
much greater effect than a similar perturbation of a neural network. For neural networks the fitness landscapes 
are smoother. Why is this? Biological neural networks need to tolerate greater environmental noise (data error) 
and processor noise (computational error), but this is only the beginning of the explanation.

Smooth fitness landscapes are a useful, necessary, and fundamental outcome of evolution. Every evolutionary 
success starts as a mutation—an error—or as a novel genetic combination. A modern organism, powerfully adaptive 
with a large reservoir of genetic complexity, necessarily possesses a very long evolutionary history; that is, 
the genotype has necessarily passed through a very large number of successful mutations and recombinations along 
the road to its current form… “Smooth fitness landscapes” imply, among other things, that a small perturbation in 
the program code (genetic noise), in the input (environmental noise), or in the state of the executing program 
(processor noise), is likely to produce at most a small degradation in output quality. In most human-written code, 
a small perturbation of any kind usually causes a crash. Genomes are built by a cumulative series of point 
mutations and random recombinations. Human-written programs start out as high-level goals which are translated, 
by an extended serial thought process, into code. A perturbation to human-written code perturbs the code’s final 
form, rather than its first cause, and the code’s final form has no history of successful mutation. The thoughts 
that gave rise to the code probably have a smooth fitness metric, in the sense that a slight perturbation to the 
programmer’s state of mind will probably produce code that is at most a little worse, and possibly a little better. 
Human thoughts, which are the original source of human-written code, are resilient; the code itself is fragile.

From [Marc Andreessen gives the career advice that nobody wants to hear](https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-whatever-you-do-dont-follow-your-passion-2014-5/?IR=T):

```markdown
"Do what you love" / "Follow your passion" is dangerous and destructive career advice. We tend to hear it 
from (a) Highly successful people who (b) Have become successful doing what they love. The problem is that 
we do NOT hear from people who have failed to become successful by doing what they love. Particularly pernicious 
problem in tournament-style fields with a few big winners lots of losers: media, athletics, startups. Better 
career advice may be "Do what contributes" -- focus on the beneficial value created for other people vs just 
one's own ego. People who contribute the most are often the most satisfied with what they do -- and in fields 
with high renumeration, make the most $. Perhaps difficult advice since requires focus on others vs oneself -- 
perhaps bad fit with endemic narcissism in modern culture? Requires delayed gratification -- may toil for many 
years to get the payoff of contributing value to the world, vs short-term happiness.

But, there's another problem, and that is the fact that statistical and probabilistic thinking is a real 
damper on "intellectual" conversation. By this, I mean that there are many individuals who wish to make 
inferences about the world based on data which they observe, or offer up general typologies to frame a 
subsequent analysis. These individuals tend to be intelligent and have college degrees. Their discussion 
ranges over topics such as politics, culture and philosophy. But, introduction of questions about the 
moments about the distribution, or skepticism as to the representativeness of their sample, and so on, tends 
to have a chilling affect on the regular flow of discussion. While the average human being engages mostly 
in gossip and interpersonal conversation of some sort, the self-consciously intellectual interject a bit of 
data and abstraction (usually in the form of jargon or pithy quotations) into the mix. But the raison d'etre 
of the intellectual discussion is basically signaling and cuing; in other words, social display. No one 
really cares about the details and attempting to generate a rigorous model is really beside the point. Trying 
to push the N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see in a college essay format) will only elicit eye-rolling 
and irritation.

It's not that clean energy will never happen -- it totally will. It's just that it won't come from a 
wild-haired scientist running out of his basement screaming, "Eureka! I've discovered how to get limitless 
clean energy from common seawater!" Instead, it will come from thousands of scientists publishing unreadable 
studies with titles like "Assessing Effectiveness and Costs of Asymmetrical Methods of Beryllium Containment 
in Gen 4 Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors When Factoring for Cromulence Decay." The world will be saved by a 
series of boring, incremental advances that chip away at those technical challenges one tedious step at a time.

But nobody wants to read about that in their morning Web browsing. We want to read that while we were sleeping, 
some unlikely hero saved the world. Or at least cured cancer.

William T. Powers:

```markdown
One thing I have advocated, without much success, is that children be taught social rules (when they are 
ready) in exactly the same way they are taught and teach each other games. The point is not whether the 
rules are right or wrong. Are the rules of 5-card stud poker or hopscotch right or wrong? It's that we're 
playing a certain game here, and there are rules to this game just as in any other game. If you want to 
be in the game, then you have to learn how to play it. Different groups of people play different games 
(different rules = different game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have to learn the 
games they play. When you develop the levels of understanding above the rule level, you'll be able to 
understand all games, and be able to join in anywhere. You won't be stuck knowing how to play only one game.

My problem with selling this idea is that people tend to think that their game is the only right one. 
In fact, being told that they are playing a game with arbitrary rules is insulting or frightening. They 
want to believe that the rules they know are the ones that everyone ought to play by; they even set 
up systems of punishment and reward to make sure that nobody tries to play a different game. They turn 
the game into something that is deadly serious, and so my idea simply seems frivolous instead of liberating.

Patrick McKenzie, "Some Perspective on the Japan Earthquake":

```markdown
The story of Japanese railways during the earthquake and tsunami is the story of an unceasing drumbeat 
of everything going right [...] The overwhelming response of Japanese engineering to the challenge posed 
by an earthquake larger than any in the last century was to function exactly as designed. Millions of 
people are alive right now because the system worked and the system worked and the system worked.

That this happened was, I say with no hint of exaggeration, one of the triumphs of human civilization. 
Every engineer in this country should be walking a little taller this week. We can’t say that too loudly, 
because it would be inappropriate with folks still missing and many families in mourning, but it doesn’t 
make it any less true.

Bruce Schneier:

```markdown
In our large, anonymous society, it's easy to forget moral and reputational pressures and concentrate on 
legal pressure and security systems. This is a mistake; even though our informal social pressures fade 
into the background, they're still responsible for most of the cooperation in society.

Razib Khan, [Reification is alright by me](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/05/reification-is-alright-by-me/):

```markdown
The categories and classes we construct are simply the semantic sugar which makes the reality go down 
easier. They should never get confused for the reality that is, the reality which we perceive but darkly 
and with biased lenses. The hyper-relativists and subjectivists who are moderately fashionable in some 
humane studies today are correct to point out that science is a human construction and endeavor. Where 
they go wrong is that they are often ignorant of the fact that the orderliness of many facets of nature 
is such that even human ignorance and stupidity can be overcome with adherence to particular methods and 
institutional checks and balances. The predictive power of modern science, giving rise to modern 
engineering, is the proof of its validity. No talk or argumentation is needed. Boot up your computer. 
Drive your car.

Paul Graham, [A student's guide to startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html):

```markdown
The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they need, 
and you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the 
real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole concept of a "good effort" 
is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in nature.

From *Cryptonomicon*, by Neal Stephenson:

```markdown
Your younger nerd takes offense quickly when someone near him begins to utter declarative sentences, 
because he reads into it an assertion that he, the nerd, does not already know the information being 
imparted. 

But your older nerd has more self-confidence, and besides, understands that frequently people need to 
think out loud. 

And highly advanced nerds will furthermore understand that uttering declarative sentences whose contents 
are already known to all present is part of the social process of making conversation and therefore 
should not be construed as aggression under any circumstances.

Hastie Dawes, *Rational Choice in an Uncertain World*, pp. 67-8:

```markdown
A lot of outcomes about which we care deeply are not very predictable. For example, it is not comforting 
to members of a graduate school admissions committee to know that only 23% of the variance in later 
faculty ratings of a student can be predicted by a unit weighting of the student's undergraduate GPA, 
his or her GRE score, and a measure of the student's undergraduate institution selectivity -- but that 
is opposed to 4% based on those committee members' global ratings of the applicant. We want to predict 
outcomes important to us. It is only rational to conclude that if one method (a linear model) does not 
predict well, something else may do better. What is not rational -- in fact, it's irrational -- is to 
conclude that this "something else" necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting 
evidence, is intuitive global judgment.
```

David Friedman, *The Machinery of Freedom*:

```markdown
The person who says, as almost everyone does say, that human life is of infinite value, not to be measured 
in mere material terms, is talking palpable, if popular, nonsense. If he believed that of his own life, he 
would never cross the street, save to visit his doctor or to earn money for things necessary to physical 
survival. He would eat the cheapest, most nutritious food he could find and live in one small room, saving 
his income for frequent visits to the best possible doctors. He would take no risks, consume no luxuries, 
and live a long life. If you call it living. If a man really believed that other people's lives were 
infinitely valuable, he would live like an ascetic, earn as much money as possible, and spend everything 
not absolutely necessary for survival on CARE packets, research into presently incurable diseases, and 
similar charities.

In fact, people who talk about the infinite value of human life do not live in either of these ways. They 
consume far more than they need to support life. They may well have cigarettes in their drawer and a sports 
car in the garage. They recognize in their actions, if not in their words, that physical survival is only 
  one value, albeit a very important one, among many.

From [Oglaf](http://oglaf.com/bugfuck/epilogue/):

```markdown
In some species of Anglerfish, the male is much smaller than the female and incapable of feeding 
independently. To survive he must smell out a female as soon as he hatches. He bites into her releasing 
an enzime which fuses him to her permanently. He lives off her blood for the rest of his life, providing 
her with sperm whenever she needs it. Females can have multiple males attached. 

The moral is simple: males are parasites, women are sluts. 

Ha! Just kidding! The moral is don't treat actual animal behavior like a fable. Generally speaking, 
animals have no interest in teaching you anything.

Terry Pratchett, *Unseen Academicals*:

```markdown
The Patrician took a sip of his beer. "I have told this to few people, gentlemen, and I suspect I never 
will again, but one day when I was a young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a 
stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even 
as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she subdued 
and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split 
and I remember to its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the 
baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. 

One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining upon mother and children. 

And that's when I first learned about evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world 
spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his 
moral superior."

Megan McArdle, [Only stupid people call people stupid](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2014-08-12/only-stupid-people-call-people-stupid):

```markdown
I’m always fascinated by the number of people who proudly build columns, tweets, blog posts or Facebook 
posts around the same core statement: “I don’t understand how anyone could (oppose legal abortion/support 
a carbon tax/sympathize with the Palestinians over the Israelis/want to privatize Social Security/insert 
your pet issue here)." It’s such an interesting statement, because it has three layers of meaning.

The first layer is the literal meaning of the words: *I lack the knowledge and understanding to figure this 
out*. But the second, intended meaning is the opposite: *I am such a superior moral being that I cannot even 
imagine the cognitive errors or moral turpitude that could lead someone to such obviously wrong conclusions*. 
And yet, the third, true meaning is actually more like the first: *I lack the empathy, moral imagination or 
analytical skills to attempt even a basic understanding of the people who disagree with me*.

In short, “I’m stupid.” Something that few people would ever post so starkly on their Facebook feeds.

Steven Pinker, [The trouble with Harvard](https://newrepublic.com/article/119321/harvard-ivy-league-should-judge-students-standardized-tests): 

```markdown
A skilled professional I know had to turn down an important freelance assignment because of a recurring 
commitment to chauffeur her son to a resumé-building “social action” assignment required by his high 
school. This involved driving the boy for 45 minutes to a community center, cooling her heels while he 
sorted used clothing for charity, and driving him back—forgoing income which, judiciously donated, could 
have fed, clothed, and inoculated an African village. The dubious “lessons” of this forced labor as an 
overqualified ragpicker are that children are entitled to treat their mothers’ time as worth nothing, 
that you can make the world a better place by destroying economic value, and that the moral worth of 
an action should be measured by the conspicuousness of the sacrifice rather than the gain to the beneficiary.
```

Douglas Hofstadter on the necessary strangeness of scientific explanations:

```markdown
It is no accident, I would maintain, that quantum mechanics is so wildly counterintuitive. Part of the 
nature of explanation is that it must eventually hit some point where further probing only increases 
opacity rather than decreasing it. 

Consider the problem of understanding the nature of solids. You might wonder where solidity comes form. 
What if someone said to you, "The ultimate basis of this brick's solidity is that it is composed of a 
stupendous number of eensy weensy bricklike objects that themselves are rock-solid"? You might be 
interested to learn that bricks are composed of micro-bricks, but the initial question - "What accounts 
for solidity?" - has been thoroughly begged. What we ultimately want is for solidity to vanish, to 
dissolve, to disintegrate into some totally different kind of phenomenon with which we have no experience. 
Only then, when we have reached some completely novel, alien level will we feel that we have really made 
progress in explaining the top-level phenomenon.

...

I first saw this thought expressed in the stimulating book Patterns of Discovery by Norwood Russell 
Hanson. Hanson attributes it to a number of thinkers, such as Isaac Newton, who wrote, in his famous 
work Opticks: "The parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another, stick together 
very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging 
the Question." Hanson also quotes James Clerk Maxwell (from an article entitled "Atom"): "We may 
indeed suppose the atom elastic, but this is to endow it with the very property for the explanation 
of which... the atomic constitution was originally assumed." Finally, here is a quote Hanson provides 
from Werner Heisenberg himself: "If atoms are really to explain the origin of color and smell of 
visible material bodies, then they cannot possess properties like color and smell." 

So, although it is not an original thought, it is useful to bear in mind that "greenness disintegrates".
