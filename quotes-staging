### Srinivasa Ramanujan
([overview](#overview))

From JE Littlewood's review of “The Collected Papers of Srinivasa Ramanujan”:

```markdown
…the most important of [Ramanujan’s methods] were completely original. His intuition worked in
analogies, sometimes, remote, and to an astonishing extent by empirical induction from particular
numerical cases. …his most important weapon seems to have been a highly elaborate technique of 
transformation by means of divergent series and integrals … He had no strict logical justification
for his operations. He was not interested in rigour, which for that matter is not of first-rate 
importance in analysis beyond the undergraduate stage, and can be supplied, given a real idea, by
any competent professional. The clear-cut idea of what is *meant* by a proof, nowadays so familiar
as to be taken for granted, he perhaps did not possess at all. If a significant piece of reasoning
occurred somewhere, and the total mixture of evidence and intuition gave him certainty, he looked 
no further. It is a minor indication of his quality that he can never have *missed* Cauchy’s
theorem. With it he could have arrived more rapidly and conveniently at certain of his results, 
but his own methods enabled him to survey the field with an equal comprehensiveness and as sure a 
grasp.

Found a [Google+ post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/fa.shogi/3aMMKIoYWhQ) by chess GM Larry Kaufman comparing various games in the chess/shogi family, apparently in response to a thread/interest in these comparisons that I can't find. 

His credentials:

```markdown
I am the only person in the world to
have earned a 2400 rating in both chess and shogi,  being an International
Master in the former and an Amateur 5 Dan in the latter. I was once
thought to be the strongest non-oriental player in the U.S. of Shang-chi
(Chinese chess), and have played roughly ten games each of Junk-ki (Korean
chess), Chu-Shogi, and Grand Chess (the modernized version of Capablanca's
10x10 chess), enough to have some feel for the good and bad points of each.
```

Very nice! Okay, so what are some key points to consider in this comparison?

```markdown
In my opinion the key points to consider in comparing the games are the

- frequency of draws in games between masters (less is better, though perhaps
a small percentage of draws may be preferred by some to none at all), 

- rough equality of chances of the two sides

- the importance of memorizing opening theory (less is better), 

- variety of play (a major objection to checkers and some might say to Go), 

- history and tradition (very desirable), 

- game length (not too short or too long, though this is subjective), 

- strategical principles (more are better), and 

- early interaction between the two sides (desirable, as if you can just do
your own thing without looking at the other player's moves, the game lacks interest).
```

On to the comparison then. Chess:

```markdown
Let's start with chess, the most widely played game (geographically) of
the family.  It ranks very highly on history and tradition, game length,
strategical principles, and early interaction.  Unfortunately the draw
percentage is too high (around 50% at high levels), and this is mostly due
to the nature of the game rather than to lack of fighting spirit.  The
chances of the two players are quite unequal, white winning about 5 games
for each 3 won by black at high level.  Memorized opening theory is way too
important at high level, though ideas like shuffle chess could solve this
problem.  Variety of play is not bad but could be much better.  So chess
gets 4 1/2 good grades out of 8.  Shuffle chess would score the same,
gaining a point on memorized theory but losing it back on history and
tradition, of which it has none.
```

Chinese chess and Korean chess:

```markdown
Now consider Chinese chess, the version of chess played by the largest
number of people world-wide, I believe.  It also ranks very highly on
history and tradition, game length, and early interaction.  I'll give it a
medium score on strategical principles (there's plenty of strategy, but less
than chess, I feel).  The draw percentage is perhaps a bit lower than in
chess, but still too high (the restriction of the elephants and ministers to
their own camp is the main reason for the draws, I believe).  The first
player has a substantial edge, though perhaps a bit less than in chess.
Memorized theory is a big problem, as in chess.  Variety of play is about
like in chess.  So I'll give Chinese chess the same 4 1/2 score as chess
got.

Korean chess is a relative of Chinese chess.  It scores a bit lower on
history and tradition, and a bit higher on the memorized theory problem,
with other scores about the same.  Let's also give it 4 1/2.
```

Chu-shogi and larger versions:

```markdown
Okay, how about Chu-shogi, the topic of much discussion on this list.
It certainly has history and tradition, though most of it is lost to us now,
so let's give it 1/2 for this.  I suspect that the percentage of draws among
masters would be very low, though I don't believe there are any masters in
the world now to test this hypothesis.  Similarly I cannot imaging that the
first move could be more than a trivial advantage, perhaps 51-49%.
Memorized opening theory is obviously not a problem; even if it existed, it
is very unlikely that this would ever be a decisive factor in such a complex
and long game.  Variety of play is obviously enormous; in fact I'll only
give it 1/2 credit because the variety of moves of the different promoted
and unpromoted pieces is far more than anyone would ever need to enjoy the
game, and simply serves to lower the standard of play by making it difficult
to ever become proficient with all the different pieces.  Game length is
much longer than most people would consider desirable, though the game is
certainly of playable length.  Early interaction certainly can occur, though
the space between the camps minimizes it, so I'll give Chu half credit here.
As for strategical principles, in my opinion there are not so many here, as
the tactical element seems to dominate the game, but I'll give it half
credit, mostly due to my not being expert enough to say for sure.  So I give
Chu 5 points, the best score so far, with the reservation that one would
have to devote an enormous amount of time to the game to acquire any real
proficiency.  I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, but since I have not
played enough to know the moves of the promoted pieces without reference to
the manual, both my skill and my enjoyment go way down late in the game.

As for the larger relatives of Chu, I must agree with  Colin Adams that
they are clearly less playable than Chu without offsetting advantages, and
so I find the constant discussion of these "games" to be rather silly.  I am
quite in agreement with George Hodges in the opinion that the really large
versions were not really meant to be played at all.  In particular versions
in which pieces demote on promotion would simply be drawish and boring.  Chu
shogi already has too many pieces, probably the reason it died out, so even
larger versions must simply be a joke.
```

Grand chess, the second-best of the lot by Kaufman's lights:

```markdown
As chu is to shogi, Grand chess is to chess.  The larger board and
extra pieces (bishop + knight and rook + knight) add a whole new dimension
to the game.  I'll have to give it a zero for history and tradition (a few
games by Capablanca don't qualify it here).  I believe the draw percentage
would be very low among masters (I haven't had one yet), and the advantage
of first move small enough.  Memorized theory doesn't exist, though it could
become a bit of a problem if the game became popular, so I'll give it 1/2
here.  Variety of play is good, more than chess without reaching the point
of overkill as with Chu, but perhaps still a bit less than I would like, so
I'll give it 3/4.  Game length seems about right to me, a bit more than
chess but nothing like Chu.  Early interaction is the same as in chess, and
the strategical principles should be similar.   So Grand chess, despite its
meager following, scores an amazing 6 1/4 out of 8 on my criteria, by far
the best so far.  It really is an excellent game and deserves a bigger
following.
```

Shogi, the best outright:

```markdown
Now for shogi, as it is currently played by millions of Japanese and a
few thousand Westerners.  History and tradition are there in abundance,
comparable to chess.  The draw % (about 2% in pro play, 1% in amateur) is
minimal (some might argue it's too low!).  The advantage of first move is
minimal (about 52-48%).  Variety of play is nearly ideal (ten piece types,
including promoted rook and bishop, versus six in chess).  Memorized theory
is a big problem, nearly as much as in chess, though the chances of turning
around a bad opening are better in shogi, so I'll give it 1/4 (maybe we need
shuffle-shogi !). Game length is ideal.  Early interaction is adequate,
though a bit less than in chess, so I'll give it 3/4.  Strategic principles
are quite ample, perhaps on a par with chess.  So shogi gets 7  out of 8,
making it clearly the winner of this "competition".

     Shogi is not a perfect game.  Some criticisms include the rather
arbitrary moves of some pieces, the occasional draw due to there being no
good way to start the fight in certain openings, the very unaesthetic need
to resolve impasse games by point count, and the fact that many games begin
with both sides moving into identical fortress formations before any
interaction occurs.  Also the strength of the Left Anaguma castle is felt by
many to be a spoiler in shogi, as for a while it seemed to relegate the
ranging rook openings  to the dustbin of history, though the recent success
of Fujii with his anti-Anaguma system seems to puncture a big hole in that
criticism.  Despite these criticisms, I think the evidence is strong that
shogi is the best game in the entire chess family, and with the risk of
offending Go players (a game which I also play and respect greatly), perhaps
the best game of all.
```

Michael Vaniver adds:

```markdown
Playing shogi is much more fun than playing chess for a novice.  The drop
rule permits one to create the position one wants in many cases, which
means that many tactical themes that occur only rarely in chess can be
"manufactured" using drops in shogi.  I also think that the fact that pawns
cannot capture forward in chess tends to create blockaded positions which
sometimes makes it hard to get any attack going.  What usually seems to
happen in these cases is that pieces get exchanged and before you know it
you're in the endgame.  Thus chess games often become a war of
attrition. This can't happen in shogi, and shogi endgames are vastly more
interesting than chess endgames by any reasonable comparison.

I agree with your assessment from my experience.  I think the only "flaw"
in shogi is the standardization of the openings, and that something like
"shuffle-shogi" will be necessary to keep the game from getting bogged down
by opening theory.  Has anyone played shuffle-shogi?  I must add that most
of what I've read on shogi seems to focus on tactics, giving the idea that
the game is primarily tactical.  I suppose this is true in the endgame, but
it would be interesting to read more about shogi strategy beyond analysis
of the opening.

I haven't played Chu (yet; I'm eager to try), but I find it hard to imagine
that a game played on a 12x12 board with 92 pieces could have less
strategical complexity than chess, played on an 8x8 board.  Perhaps you
could elaborate here?  Wayne Schmittberger has argued that the tactical
complexity of Chu is so great that, in fact, strategy dominates tactics
because it's hard to read many moves deep, and so the important thing for
Chu players is to learn to intuitively assess the merits of a position,
much as Go players have to.

## Game complexity measures
([overview](#overview))

Found an interesting notion of "game depth" by renowned computer scientist and chess IM RJ Lipton in his post [The New Chess World Champion](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/12/28/the-new-chess-world-champion/). First the motivation/appetizer:

```markdown
GM Larry Kaufman and I have had closely similar chess ratings for four decades. However, in
the last game we played he gave me odds of rook and bishop and beat me handily. Then he told 
me that the world champion could probably beat him giving the same odds.

This was not Western chess, where I would be pretty confident of beating anyone given just an
extra bishop. It was Japanese chess, called Shogi. Shogi has no piece with the power of a queen,
and the armies have just one rook and bishop each, so the odds I received were maximal. The main
difference from Western chess is that captured pieces become their taker’s property and can be 
“paratrooped” back into the game. This prevents the odds receiver from winning by attrition 
through exchanges as prevails in chess, and throws upon the leader a burden of attack.

It also makes Shogi *deeper* than chess in a way that can be defined mathematically.
```

Ooh, but what is this? Say more words!

```markdown
Say two players are a "class unit" apart if the stronger expects to score 75% against the
weaker in a match. In chess, this corresponds to a difference of almost exactly 200 points
in the standard Elo rating system. László Mérő, in his 1990 book Ways of Thinking, called 
the number of class units from a typical beginning adult player to the human world champion
the "depth" of a game.

Tic-tac-toe may have a depth of 1: if you assume a beginner knows to block an immediate threat
of three-in-a-row but plays randomly otherwise, then you can score over 75% by taking a corner
when you go first and grifting a few games when you go second. Another school-recess game, 
dots-and-boxes, is evidently deeper. We don’t know its depth for sure because it doesn’t have 
a rating system and championship format like chess does.

Chess ratings in the US go all the way down to the formal floor of 100 among scholastic players,
but I concur with the estimate of Elo 600 for a young-adult beginner by a discussion of Mérő’s 
book which I saw in the 1990s but did not preserve. This gave chess a depth of 11 class units up
to 2800, which was world champion Garry Kasparov’s rating in 1990. If I recall correctly, 
checkers (8x8) and backgammon had depth 10 while bridge tied chess at 11, but Shogi scored 14 and
yet was dwarfed by Japan’s main head game, Go, at 25.
```

Whoa, *seriously*? Go's depth is 25?? 

How this relates to computer players:

```markdown
Although it is coming on 18 years since Deep Blue beat Kasparov, humans are still barely fending
off computers at shogi, while we retain some breathing room at Go. Since depth 14 translates to 
Elo 3400 on the chess scale, while Komodo 8 is scraping 3300 on several chess rating lists, This 
feels about right.

Ten years ago, each doubling of speed was thought to add 50 Elo points to strength. Now the 
estimate is closer to 30. Under the double-in-2-years version of Moore’s Law, using an average of
50 Elo gained per doubling since Kasparov was beaten, one gets 450 Elo over 18 years, which again
checks out.

To be sure, the gains in computer chess have come from better algorithms not just speed, and 
include nonlinear jumps, so Go should not count on a cushion of (25 – 14)*9 = 99 years.
```

Indeed it shouldn't. The post was written in 2014; AlphaGo beat the strongest player in the world only 3-4 years later.

Weakness of this metric:

```markdown
One weakness in the notion of depth is dependence on how contests are aggregated. For tennis, 
should we apply 75% expectation to games, pairs of games, sets, or matches—and how many games 
in a set or sets in a match? 

Another is that any game can be ‘reduced’ to depth 1 by flipping a coin; if heads the game is 
played as-usual; if tails a second coin flip defines the outcome. Then nobody ever has more
than 75% expectation. I regard both as beside the point for most board games, but both become
nontrivial for games like backgammon that involve chance and are played with match stakes.
```


- rename to math maturity and understanding
(UNDER MATH MATURITY)

Michael Nielsen has [a great essay](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics) talking about how he used spaced repetition via Anki flashcards to iteratively deepen his understanding of ("see through") a math concept. See also [Nielsen on augmenting long-term memory](#augmenting-long-term-memory). 

First -- on understanding in math being not black and white but layered / spectrum:

```markdown
What does it mean to understand a piece of mathematics? Naively, we perhaps think of this 
in relatively black and white terms: initially you don’t understand a piece of mathematics,
then you go through a brief grey period where you’re learning it, and with some luck and 
hard work you emerge out the other side “understanding” the mathematics.

In reality, mathematical understanding is much more nuanced. My experience is that it’s
nearly always possible to deepen one’s understanding of any piece of mathematics. This is 
even true – perhaps especially true – of what appear to be very simple mathematical ideas.

I first really appreciated this after reading an essay by the mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov.
You might suppose a great mathematician such as Kolmogorov would be writing about some very 
complicated piece of mathematics, but his subject was the humble equals sign: what made it a
good piece of notation, and what its deficiencies were. Kolmogorov discussed this in loving 
detail, and made many beautiful points along the way, e.g., that the invention of the equals
sign helped make possible notions such as equations (and algebraic manipulations of equations).

Prior to reading the essay I thought I understood the equals sign. Indeed, I would have been
offended by the suggestion that I did not. But the essay showed convincingly that I could 
understand the equals sign much more deeply.

This experience suggested three broader points. First, it’s possible to understand other 
pieces of mathematics far more deeply than I assumed. Second, mathematical understanding 
is an open-ended process; it’s nearly always possible to go deeper. Third, even great
mathematicians – perhaps, especially, great mathematicians – thought it worth their time
to engage in such deepening.
```

Nielsen being Nielsen, he gets excited about how to make iterative deepening of mathematical understanding actionable via heuristics. He's collected "many such heuristics over the years"; his essay talks about Anki. 

Does this really depend on Anki though? Not really:

```markdown
There’s very little in the above process that explicitly depended on me using Anki’s spaced-
repetition flashcards. Rather, what I’ve described is a general process for pulling apart 
the proof of a theorem and making much more sense of it, essentially by atomizing the 
elements. There’s no direct connection to Anki at all – you could carry out the process 
using paper and pencil.
```

Here's the "Ankification" of the proof of the following theorem: "a complex normal matrix is always diagonalizable by a unitary matrix".

```markdown
*Phase I: understanding the proof*: This involves multiple passes over the proof. Initially,
it starts out with what I think of as grazing, picking out single elements of the proof and 
converting to Anki cards. ... 

I work hard to restate ideas in multiple ways. Indeed, I worked hard to simplify both questions
and answers – the just given question-and-answer pair started out somewhat more complicated.
Part of this was some minor complexity in the question, which I gradually trimmed down. The 
answer I’ve stated above, though, is much better than in earlier versions. Earlier versions
mentioned M explicitly (unnecessary), had more blocks in the matrices, used ⋯⋯ rather than 
⋅⋅, and so on. You want to aim for the minimal answer, displaying the core idea as sharply as 
possible. 

I can’t emphasize enough the value of finding multiple different ways of thinking about the
“same” mathematical ideas. Here’s a couple more related restatements:

*Q: What’s a geometric interpretation of the diagonal entries in the matrix MM†?

A: The lengths squared of the respective rows.

Q: What’s a geometric interpretation of the diagonal entries in the matrix M†M?

A: The lengths squared of the respective columns.

Q: What do the diagonal elements of the normalcy condition MM†=M†M mean geometrically?

A: The corresponding row and column lengths are the same.*

What you’re trying to do at this stage is learn your way around the proof. Every piece
should become a comfortable part of your mental furniture, ideally something you start to
really feel. That means understanding every idea in multiple ways, and finding as many 
connections between different ideas as possible.

People inexperienced at mathematics sometimes memorize proofs as linear lists of statements.
A more useful way is to think of proofs is as interconnected networks of simple observations.
Things are rarely true for just one reason; finding multiple explanations for things gives 
you an improved understanding. This is in some sense “inefficient”, but it’s also a way of
deepening understanding and improving intuition. You’re building out the network of the proof,
making more connections between nodes.

One way of doing this is to explore minor variations. ...

(By the way, it’s questions like these that make me think it helps to be fairly 
mathematically experienced in carrying this Ankification process out. For someone who has
done a lot of linear algebra these are very natural observations to make, and questions to
ask. But I’m not sure they would be so natural for everyone. The ability to ask the “right”
questions – insight-generating questions – is a limiting part of this whole process, and
requires some experience.)

I’ve been describing the grazing process, aiming to thoroughly familiarize yourself with
every element of the proof. This is useful, but is also a rather undirected process, with 
no clear end point, and not necessarily helping you understand the broader to structure of
the proof. I also impose on myself a set of aspirational goals, all variations on the idea 
of distilling the entire proof to one question and (simple) answer. The aim is to fill in 
the answers to questions having forms like:

*Q: In one sentence, what is the core reason a (complex) normal matrix is diagonalizable?

And:

Q: What is a simple visual representation of the proof that (complex) normal matrices are
diagonalizable?*

I think of these question templates as boundary conditions or forcing functions. They’re 
things to aim for, and I try to write questions that will help me move toward answers. That 
starts with grazing, but over time moves to more structural questions about the proof, and
about how elements fit together.

In general, it’s helpful to make both questions and answers as atomic as possible; it seems
to help build clarity. That atomicity doesn’t mean the questions and answers can’t involve 
quite sophisticated concepts, but they ideally express a single idea.

In practice, as I understand the proof better and better the aspirational goal cards change
their nature somewhat.

What you really want is to feel every element (and the connections between them) in your 
bones. Some substantial part of that feeling comes by actually constructing the cards. That’s
a feeling you can’t get merely by reading an essay, it can only be experienced by going
through the deep Ankification process yourself. Nonetheless, I find that process, as described
up to now, is also not quite enough. You can improve upon it by asking further questions
elaborating on different parts of the answer, with the intent of helping you understand the
answer better.

Another helpful trick is to have multiple ways of writing these top-level questions. Much of 
my thinking is non-verbal (especially in subjects I’m knowledgeable about), but I still find
it useful to force a verbal question-and-answer...

*Phase II: variations, pushing the boundaries*: Let’s get back to details of how the
Ankification process works. One way of deepening your understanding further is to find ways
of pushing the boundaries of the proof and of the theorem. I find it helpful to consider many
different ways of changing the assumptions of the theorem, and to ask how it breaks down (or
generalizes). Another good strategy is to ask if the conditions can be weakened. ...

This second phase really is open-ended: we can keep putting in variations essentially ad 
infinitum. The questions are no longer directly about the proof, but rather are about poking
it in various ways, and seeing what happens. The further I go, and the more I connect to other
results, the better.
```

"Exhaust" cards:

```markdown
As described, this deep Ankification process can feel rather wasteful. Inevitably, over 
time my understanding of the proof changes. When that happens it’s often useful to rewrite
(and sometimes discard or replace) cards to reflect my improved understanding. And some of
the cards written along the way have the flavor of exhaust, bad cards that seem to be
necessary to get to good cards. I wish I had a good way of characterizing these, but I 
haven’t gone through this often enough to have more than fuzzy ideas about it.
```

How it feels like to "be inside a piece of mathematics":

```markdown
Typically, my mathematical work begins with paper-and-pen and messing about, often in
a rather ad hoc way. But over time if I really get into something my thinking starts to
change. I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with. It becomes 
easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. I will go on long walks, and
simply think intensively about the objects of concern. Those are no longer symbolic or 
verbal or visual in the conventional way, though they have some secondary aspects of 
this nature. Rather, the sense is somehow of working directly with the objects of 
concern, without any direct symbolic or verbal or visual referents. Furthermore, as my 
understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my
own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as
though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get 
much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways.

This is a very difficult experience to describe in a way that I’m confident others will
understand, but it really is central to my experience of mathematics – at least, of 
mathematics that I understand well. I must admit I’ve shared it with some trepidation; 
it seems to be rather unusual for someone to describe their inner mathematical experiences
in these terms (or, more broadly, in the terms used in this essay).
```

Related is Einstein's musings in his letter to Hadamard describing his thought processes:

```markdown
The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role 
in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in 
thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be “voluntarily” 
reproduced and combined… The above-mentioned elements are, in my case, of visual and some
of muscular type. Conventional words or other signs have to be sought for laboriously 
only in a secondary stage, when the mentioned associative play is sufficiently established
and can be reproduced at will.
```

Nielsen thinks this is all chunking:

```markdown
People who intensively study a subject gradually start to build mental libraries of “chunks” 
– large-scale patterns that they recognize and use to reason. This is why some grandmaster 
chess players can remember thousands of games move for move. They’re not remembering the 
individual moves – they’re remembering the ideas those games express, in terms of larger 
patterns. And they’ve studied chess so much that those ideas and patterns are deeply
meaningful, much as the phrases in a lover’s letter may be meaningful. It’s why top 
basketball players have extraordinary recall of games. Experts begin to think, perhaps only
semi-consciously, using such chunks. The conventional representations – words or symbols in
mathematics, or moves on a chessboard – are still there, but they are somehow secondary.
```

This segues into Terry Tao's [three stages of mathematical education](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/) article:

```markdown
One can roughly divide mathematical education into three stages:

1. The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal, intuitive 
manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. (For instance, calculus is 
usually first introduced in terms of slopes, areas, rates of change, and so forth.) 
The emphasis is more on computation than on theory. This stage generally lasts until 
the early undergraduate years.

2. The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”,
one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner (e.g. re-doing calculus
by using epsilons and deltas all over the place). The emphasis is now primarily on theory;
and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects
without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies 
the later undergraduate and early graduate years.

3. The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous 
foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-
rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by 
rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and accurately 
perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or informal
and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be able to 
convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is 
now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late
graduate years and beyond.

The transition from the first stage to the second is well known to be rather traumatic, with
the dreaded “proof-type questions” being the bane of many a maths undergraduate. But the
transition from the second to the third is equally important, and should not be forgotten.

It is of course vitally important that you know how to think rigorously, as this gives you
the discipline to avoid many common errors and purge many misconceptions. Unfortunately, this
has the unintended consequence that “fuzzier” or “intuitive” thinking (such as heuristic
reasoning, judicious extrapolation from examples, or analogies with other contexts such as 
physics) gets deprecated as “non-rigorous”. All too often, one ends up discarding one’s
initial intuition and is only able to process mathematics at a formal level, thus getting 
stalled at the second stage of one’s mathematical education.  (Among other things, this can
impact one’s ability to read mathematical papers; an overly literal mindset can lead to 
“compilation errors” when one encounters even a single typo or ambiguity in such a paper.)

The point of rigour is not to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used to destroy 
bad intuition while clarifying and elevating good intuition. It is only with a combination
of both rigorous formalism and good intuition that one can tackle complex mathematical
problems; one needs the former to correctly deal with the fine details, and the latter to 
correctly deal with the big picture. Without one or the other, you will spend a lot of time
blundering around in the dark (which can be instructive, but is highly inefficient). So once
you are fully comfortable with rigorous mathematical thinking, you should revisit your
intuitions on the subject and use your new thinking skills to test and refine these intuitions
rather than discard them. One way to do this is to ask yourself dumb questions; another is 
to relearn your field.

The ideal state to reach is when every heuristic argument naturally suggests its rigorous 
counterpart, and vice versa. Then you will be able to tackle maths problems by using both 
halves of your brain at once – i.e., the same way you already tackle problems in “real life”.
```

It is perhaps worth noting that mathematicians at all three of the above stages of 
mathematical development can still make formal mistakes in their mathematical writing.
However, the nature of these mistakes tends to be rather different, depending on what 
stage one is at:

1. Mathematicians at the pre-rigorous stage of development often make formal errors 
because they are unable to understand how the rigorous mathematical formalism actually 
works, and are instead applying formal rules or heuristics blindly.  It can often be 
quite difficult for such mathematicians to appreciate and correct these errors even 
when those errors are explicitly pointed out to them.

2. Mathematicians at the rigorous stage of development can still make formal errors
because they have not yet perfected their formal understanding, or are unable to perform
enough “sanity checks” against intuition or other rules of thumb to catch, say, a sign
error, or a failure to correctly verify a crucial hypothesis in a tool.  However, such 
errors can usually be detected (and often repaired) once they are pointed out to them.

3. Mathematicians at the post-rigorous stage of development are not infallible, and are
still capable of making formal errors in their writing.  But this is often because they
no longer need the formalism in order to perform high-level mathematical reasoning, and 
are actually proceeding largely through intuition, which is then translated (possibly 
incorrectly) into formal mathematical language.

The distinction between the three types of errors can lead to the phenomenon (which can
often be quite puzzling to readers at earlier stages of mathematical development) of a 
mathematical argument by a post-rigorous mathematician which locally contains a number
of typos and other formal errors, but is globally quite sound, with the local errors 
propagating for a while before being cancelled out by other local errors.  (In contrast,
when unchecked by a solid intuition, once an error is introduced in an argument by a pre-
rigorous or rigorous mathematician, it is possible for the error to propagate out of 
control until one is left with complete nonsense at the end of the argument.)

Commenter Chris makes the following claim:

```markdown
I’d call pre-rigorous the “cargo cult” stage. You’re not doing mathematics, you’re merely
performing a very close approximation to it using rote learned rules. It was this sort of
mathematics taught in the first year of the undergraduate curriculum at my university which 
caused me to take physics as my major.

Physicists and engineers call the third type of mathematics you propose a “back of the
envelope” calculation. I suspect the less pretentious mathematicians do also. It is the
step you use to flesh out a hypothesis before you apply rigour.
```

I only recorded it as context for Terry's response:

```markdown
Hmm. I think perhaps I would classify the “back of the envelope” calculations as a 
fourth stage, let’s call it the “heuristic” stage, in the following, almost commuting square:

pre-rigorous —> rigorous
| ……………………….|
v ……………………….v
heuristic —> post-rigorous

As I discussed in the post, mathematicians tend to proceed through the upper route, but I
do see the point that physicists and engineers tend to proceed through the lower route. 
Though, as I said, the diagram doesn’t quite commute; there are some significant cultural
differences in doing mathematics that depend on which route one took to achieve the post-
rigorous stage.

The distinction between heuristic and post-rigorous is that in the latter, one uses
intuition and rigour in an integrated fashion; one knows how to justify one’s intuition
and convert it to rigorous arguments, and conversely one knows how to take rigorous 
arguments and extract an intuitive explanation. For instance, one could convert arguments
involving infinitesimals into rigorous epsilon-delta arguments whenever required, and vice
versa. At the heuristic level, one could argue accurately with infinitesimals, but might 
not be able to convert them into a rigorous argument.

Just as mathematicians sometimes get stuck at the rigorous stage, unable to fully develop
their intuition, I would imagine that the converse problem can happen to people educated 
using the physicist/engineer approach, who then miss out on the stereoscopic view that one
gets from using both rigour and intuition simultaneously.

Going back to Nielsen's chunking above, there's also Bill Thurston's legendary MO question [Thinking and explaining](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38639/thinking-and-explaining), whose favorite answers I'm quoting wholesale below.

Here's the [legendary answer by Anonymous Quoran](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-understand-advanced-mathematics-Does-it-feel-analogous-to-having-mastery-of-another-language-like-in-programming-or-linguistics/answers/873950?amp&share=1&srid=p6KQ) I always have to much around in the Google search results to get at for some reason:

```markdown
**You can answer many seemingly difficult questions quickly**. But you are not very impressed
by what can look like magic, because you know the trick. The trick is that your brain can
quickly decide if a question is answerable by one of a few powerful general purpose "machines"
(e.g., continuity arguments, the correspondences between geometric and algebraic objects,
linear algebra, ways to reduce the infinite to the finite through various forms of
compactness) combined with specific facts you have learned about your area. The number of
fundamental ideas and techniques that people use to solve problems is, perhaps surprisingly,
pretty small -- see http://www.tricki.org/tricki/map for a partial list, maintained by Timothy
Gowers.

**You are often confident that something is true long before you have an airtight proof for it
(this happens especially often in geometry)**. The main reason is that you have a large 
catalogue of connections between concepts, and you can quickly intuit that if X were to be 
false, that would create tensions with other things you know to be true, so you are inclined 
to believe X is probably true to maintain the harmony of the conceptual space. It's not so much 
that you can imagine the situation perfectly, but you can quickly imagine many other things that
are logically connected to it.

**You are comfortable with feeling like you have no deep understanding of the problem you are 
studying**. Indeed, when you do have a deep understanding, you have solved the problem and it 
is time to do something else. This makes the total time you spend in life reveling in your mastery
of something quite brief. One of the main skills of research scientists of any type is knowing how
to work comfortably and productively in a state of confusion. More on this in the next few bullets.

**Your intuitive thinking about a problem is productive and usefully structured, wasting little 
time on being aimlessly puzzled**. For example, when answering a question about a high-dimensional
space (e.g., whether a certain kind of rotation of a five-dimensional object has a "fixed point"
which does not move during the rotation), you do not spend much time straining to visualize those 
things that do not have obvious analogues in two and three dimensions. (Violating this principle
is a huge source of frustration for beginning maths students who don't know that they shouldn't be
straining to visualize things for which they don't seem to have the visualizing machinery.) Instead...

**When trying to understand a new thing, you automatically focus on very simple examples that 
are easy to think about, and then you leverage intuition about the examples into more impressive
insights**. For example, you might imagine two- and three-dimensional rotations that are analogous
to the one you really care about, and think about whether they clearly do or don't have the 
desired property. Then you think about what was important to the examples and try to distill those
ideas into symbols. Often, you see that the key idea in the symbolic manipulations doesn't depend
on anything about two or three dimensions, and you know how to answer your hard question. 

**As you get more mathematically advanced, the examples you consider easy are actually complex 
insights built up from many easier examples; the "simple case" you think about now took you two
years to become comfortable with**. But at any given stage, you do not strain to obtain a magical
illumination about something intractable; you work to reduce it to the things that feel friendly.

To me, **the biggest misconception that non-mathematicians have about how mathematicians work is that 
there is some mysterious mental faculty that is used to crack a research problem all at once**. It's 
true that sometimes you can solve a problem by pattern-matching, where you see the standard tool 
that will work; the first bullet above is about that phenomenon. This is nice, but not fundamentally
more impressive than other confluences of memory and intuition that occur in normal life, as when
you remember a trick to use for hanging a picture frame or notice that you once saw a painting of 
the street you're now looking at.

In any case, by the time a problem gets to be a research problem, it's almost guaranteed that
simple pattern matching won't finish it. So in one's professional work, the process is piecemeal:
you think a few moves ahead, trying out possible attacks from your arsenal on simple examples 
relating to the problem, trying to establish partial results, or looking to make analogies with 
other ideas you understand. This is the same way that you solve difficult problems in your first
real maths courses in university and in competitions. What happens as you get more advanced is 
simply that the arsenal grows larger, the thinking gets somewhat faster due to practice, and you
have more examples to try. Sometimes, during this process, a sudden insight comes, but it would 
not be possible without the painstaking groundwork [ http://terrytao.wordpress.com/ca... ].

Indeed, most of the bullet points here summarize feelings familiar to many serious students of 
mathematics who are in the middle of their undergraduate careers; as you learn more mathematics,
these experiences apply to "bigger" things but have the same fundamental flavor.

**You go up in abstraction, "higher and higher"**. The main object of study yesterday becomes 
just an example or a tiny part of what you are considering today. For example, in calculus
classes you think about functions or curves. In functional analysis or algebraic geometry, you
think of spaces whose points are functions or curves -- that is, you "zoom out" so that every
function is just a point in a space, surrounded by many other "nearby" functions. Using this 
kind of zooming out technique, you can say very complex things in short sentences -- things 
that, if unpacked and said at the zoomed-in level, would take up pages. Abstracting and 
compressing in this way makes it possible to consider extremely complicated issues with one's 
limited memory and processing power.

**The particularly "abstract" or "technical" parts of many other subjects seem quite accessible
because they boil down to maths you already know. You generally feel confident about your ability
to learn most quantitative ideas and techniques**. A theoretical physicist friend likes to say, 
only partly in jest, that there should be books titled "______ for Mathematicians", where _____ 
is something generally believed to be difficult (quantum chemistry, general relativity, securities
pricing, formal epistemology). Those books would be short and pithy, because many key concepts in 
those subjects are ones that mathematicians are well equipped to understand. Often, those parts 
can be explained more briefly and elegantly than they usually are if the explanation can assume a
knowledge of maths and a facility with abstraction. 

Learning the domain-specific elements of a different field can still be hard -- for instance,
physical intuition and economic intuition seem to rely on tricks of the brain that are not 
learned through mathematical training alone. But the quantitative and logical techniques you 
sharpen as a mathematician allow you to take many shortcuts that make learning other fields
easier, as long as you are willing to be humble and modify those mathematical habits that are 
not useful in the new field.

**You move easily among multiple seemingly very different ways of representing a problem**. For
example, most problems and concepts have more algebraic representations (closer in spirit to an 
algorithm) and more geometric ones (closer in spirit to a picture). You go back and forth between
them naturally, using whichever one is more helpful at the moment. 

Indeed, some of the most powerful ideas in mathematics (e.g., duality, Galois theory, algebraic
geometry) provide "dictionaries" for moving between "worlds" in ways that, ex ante, are very 
surprising. For example, Galois theory allows us to use our understanding of symmetries of shapes
(e.g., rigid motions of an octagon) to understand why you can solve any fourth-degree polynomial
equation in closed form, but not any fifth-degree polynomial equation. Once you know these threads
between different parts of the universe, you can use them like wormholes to extricate yourself 
from a place where you would otherwise be stuck. The next two bullets expand on this.

**Spoiled by the power of your best tools, you tend to shy away from messy calculations or long,
case-by-case arguments unless they are absolutely unavoidable**. Mathematicians develop a powerful
attachment to elegance and depth, which are in tension with, if not directly opposed to, mechanical
calculation. Mathematicians will often spend days figuring out why a result follows easily from some 
very deep and general pattern that is already well-understood, rather than from a string of 
calculations. Indeed, you tend to choose problems motivated by how likely it is that there will be 
some "clean" insight in them, as opposed to a detailed but ultimately unenlightening proof by
exhaustively enumerating a bunch of possibilities. (Nevertheless, detailed calculation of an example 
is often a crucial part of beginning to see what is really going on in a problem; and, depending on
the field, some calculation often plays an essential role even in the best proof of a result.)

In A Mathematician's Apology [http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mss..., the most poetic book I know on what it is "like" to be a mathematician], G.H. Hardy wrote:

"In both [these example] theorems (and in the theorems, of course, I include the proofs) there is a
very high degree of unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and  economy. The arguments take so
odd and surprising a form; the weapons used seem so childishly simple when compared with  the far-
reaching results; but there is no escape from the conclusions. There are no complications of detail—
one line of attack is enough in each case; and this is true too of the proofs of many much more 
difficult theorems, the full appreciation of which demands quite a high degree of technical
proficiency. We do not want many ‘variations’ in the proof of a mathematical theorem: ‘enumeration 
of cases’, indeed, is one of the duller forms of mathematical argument. A mathematical proof should
resemble a simple and clear-cut constellation, not a scattered cluster in the Milky Way."

[...]

"[A solution to a difficult chess problem] is quite genuine mathematics, and has its merits; but it
is just that ‘proof by enumeration of cases’ (and of cases which do not, at bottom, differ at all
profoundly) which a real mathematician tends to despise."

**You develop a strong aesthetic preference for powerful and general ideas that connect hundreds of
difficult questions, as opposed to resolutions of particular puzzles**. Mathematicians don't really
care about "the answer" to any particular question; even the most sought-after theorems, like
Fermat's Last Theorem, are only tantalizing because their difficulty tells us that we have to 
develop very good tools and understand very new things to have a shot at proving them. It is
what we get in the process, and not the answer per se, that is the valuable thing. The 
accomplishment a mathematician seeks is finding a new dictionary or wormhole between different 
parts of the conceptual universe. As a result, many mathematicians do not focus on deriving the 
practical or computational implications of their studies (which can be a drawback of the hyper-
abstract approach!); instead, they simply want to find the most powerful and general connections.
Timothy Gowers has some interesting comments on this issue, and disagreements within the 
mathematical community about it [ http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg1... ].

**Understanding something abstract or proving that something is true becomes a task a lot like
building something**. You think: "First I will lay this foundation, then I will build this framework
using these familiar pieces, but leave the walls to fill in later, then I will test the beams..." 
All these steps have mathematical analogues, and structuring things in a modular way allows you to 
spend several days thinking about something you do not understand without feeling lost or frustrated.
(I should say, "without feeling unbearably lost and frustrated"; some amount of these feelings is 
inevitable, but the key is to reduce them to a tolearable degree.)

Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, used an "exploring" metaphor:

"Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of a journey through a
dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the mansion and it's completely dark. You 
stumble around bumping into the furniture, but gradually you learn where each piece of furniture
is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it's
all illuminated. You can see exactly where you were. Then you move into the next room and spend 
another six months in the dark. So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they're momentary,
sometimes over a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of—and couldn't exist without—
the many months of stumbling around in the dark that proceed them." [ http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/phy... ]

**In listening to a seminar or while reading a paper, you don't get stuck as much as you used to**
in youth because you are good at modularizing a conceptual space, taking certain calculations or
arguments you don't understand as "black boxes", and considering their implications anyway. You
can sometimes make statements you know are true and have good intuition for, without understanding
all the details. You can often detect where the delicate or interesting part of something is based
on only a very high-level explanation. (I first saw these phenomena highlighted by Ravi Vakil, who
offers insightful advice on being a mathematics student: http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/... .)

**You are good at generating your own definitions and your own questions in thinking about some new
kind of abstraction**. One of the things one learns fairly late in a typical mathematical education 
(often only at the stage of starting to do research) is how to make good, useful definitions.
Something I've reliably heard from people who know parts of mathematics well but never went on to be
professional mathematicians (i.e., write articles about new mathematics for a living) is that they
were good at proving difficult propositions that were stated in a textbook exercise, but would be
lost if presented with a mathematical structure and asked to find and prove some interesting facts 
about it. Concretely, the ability to do this amounts to being good at making definitions and, using
the newly defined concepts, formulating precise results that other mathematicians find intriguing or
enlightening. 

This kind of challenge is like being given a world and asked to find events in it that come together 
to form a good detective story. You have to figure out who the characters should be (the concepts 
and objects you define) and what the interesting mystery might be. To do these things, you use 
analogies with other detective stories (mathematical theories) that you know and a taste for what
is surprising or deep. How this process works is perhaps the most difficult aspect of mathematical
work to describe precisely but also the thing that I would guess is the strongest thing that 
mathematicians have in common.

**You are easily annoyed by imprecision in talking about the quantitative or logical**. This is
mostly because you are trained to quickly think about counterexamples that make an imprecise claim
seem obviously false.

**On the other hand, you are very comfortable with intentional imprecision or "hand-waving" in areas
you know, because you know how to fill in the details**. Terence Tao is very eloquent about this here 
[ http://terrytao.wordpress.com/ca... ]: 

"[After learning to think rigorously, comes the] 'post-rigorous' stage, in which one has grown 
comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit
and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly
buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and 
accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or
informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be able to
convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is now 
on applications, intuition, and the 'big picture'. This stage usually occupies the late graduate
years and beyond."

In particular, an idea that took hours to understand correctly the first time ("for any arbitrarily
small epsilon I can find a small delta so that this statement is true") becomes such a basic element
of your later thinking that you don't give it conscious thought.

Before wrapping up, it is worth mentioning that mathematicians are not immune to the limitations 
faced by most others. They are not typically intellectual superheroes. For instance, they often 
become resistant to new ideas and uncomfortable with ways of thinking (even about mathematics) 
that are not their own. They can be defensive about intellectual turf, dismissive of others, or
petty in their disputes. Above, I have tried to summarize how the mathematical way of thinking 
feels and works at its best, without focusing on personality flaws of mathematicians or on the 
politics of various mathematical fields. These issues are worthy of their own long answers!

**You are humble about your knowledge because you are aware of how weak maths is, and you are comfortable
with the fact that you can say nothing intelligent about most problems**. There are only very few
mathematical questions to which we have reasonably insightful answers. There are even fewer questions,
obviously, to which any given mathematician can give a good answer. After two or three years of a 
standard university curriculum, a good maths undergraduate can effortlessly write down hundreds of
mathematical questions to which the very best mathematicians could not venture even a tentative answer.
(The theoretical computer scientist Richard Lipton lists some examples of potentially "deep" ignorance 
here: http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/20...) This makes it more comfortable to be stumped by most problems;
a sense that you know roughly what questions are tractable and which are currently far beyond our abilities
is humbling, but also frees you from being very intimidated, because you do know you are familiar with the
most powerful apparatus we have for dealing with these kinds of problems.
