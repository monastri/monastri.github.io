### Anglerfish and beacons
([overview](#overview))

Ben Hoffman talks about avoiding anglerfish, or Chapman's sociopaths, in a great essay I often come back to called [On the construction of beacons](http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/construction-beacons/). I tried not to just copy-paste everything, but Ben doesn't waste words, he's a precision writer, so it's hard to leave things out because "everything is in its place" so to speak.

First of all, why "anglerfish"?

```markdown
The anglerfish lives in waters too far beneath the surface of the sea for sunlight to reach.
It dangles a luminescent lure in front of itself. This resembles a fishing angle, whence 
comes its name. This lure attracts animals of the deep sea, which approach the anglerfish, 
and are consequently eaten by it.

Why - in the deep sea where no sunlight can reach - would evolution favor animals that are
attracted to light?

The secondary uses of such a strategy are clear enough. Once some deep-sea-dwellers emit
light, larger animals that predate on them might do better if attracted to light sources. 
But that presupposes the existence of other animals that already emit light, for other
reasons.

What are the primary uses of light? In a region where no other creatures emit light, here 
are some reasons why would might begin to do so:

1. To illuminate potential prey.
2. As a ward, to warn potential competitors that one is prepared to defend territory.
3. To attract complementary animals, either as symbiotes, or as mates.

In all these cases, the purpose of the light is to *reveal information*. In all but the
first case, it is to *share information with others, in order to enable cooperation*. 
Perhaps the purest version of this is the mating display. We can see this in the firefly, 
which uses its distinctive patterns of luminescent flashes to find mates.

The firefly has some information. It activates a beacon, in order to find someone with 
*complementary information*, in order to engage in *productive exchange*. Likewise for 
deep-sea fish who mate or find symbiotes by means of a light display.

The predation strategy of the anglerfish, properly generalized is a strategy that predates
on all information-seeking behavior, whether competitive or cooperative. The anglerfish
does not need to know that the animal that just swam in front of it is evaluating its 
mating display and finds it wanting, or is looking for a very different creature as a 
symbiote. So long as there are animals seeking illumination, the anglerfish only cares that
some calories and raw materials have been brought within reach of a single burst of 
swimming and the clamping shut of its great maw.

Typically, a predator has to be more sophisticated than the creatures on which it preys.
But the anglerfish follows a simple, information-poor strategy, that preys on sophisticated,
information-rich ones. It doesn’t have to be a particularly skilled mimic - it simply preys
on the fact that creatures seeking information will move towards beacons.

How does this analogize to subculture dilution?

```markdown
In David Chapman’s geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths, “geeks” are the originators of subcultures. 
They are persons of refined taste and discernment. They found subcultures by discovering or
creating something they believe to be of intrinsic value. The originators of this information
share it with others, and the first to respond enthusiastically will be other geeks, who can 
tell that the content of the message is valuable.

Eventually, enough geeks congregate together, and the thing they are creating together becomes
valuable enough, that people without the power to independently discern the source of value 
can tell that value is being created. These Chapman calls “Members Of the Public”, or “MOP”s. 
Geeks map roughly onto Aellagirl's possums, MOPs onto otters.

In the right ratios, MOPs and Geeks are symbiotes. The MOPs enjoy the benefits of the thing the
geeks created, and are generally happy to share their social capital, including money, with the
geeks.

But from another perspective MOPs are an exploitable resource, which the geeks have gathered in
one place but are neither efficiently exploiting, nor effectively defending. This attracts
people following a strategy of predating on such clusters of MOPs. These predators, whom Chapman
names “sociopaths,” do not care about the idiosyncratic value the geeks are busy creating. What 
they do care about, is the generic resources - attention, money, volunteer hours, social proof -
that the MOPs provide.

To summarize the above: Geeks build beacons. Initially these beacons are not very bright, but
they are sending out high-information signals which attract other geeks looking for that 
information. Eventually, enough geeks are contributing to the beacons that they become bright
enough to attract MOPs.

Chapman’s sociopaths can’t just waltz in and propose that everyone give them things for nothing.
After all, everyone in their feeding ground was attracted to it by something about it, something
that distinguishes it from other places in the culture. They need to look like a part of the 
scene. So they start by imitating, or proposing refinements to, the beacons the geeks have erected.

The geeks are only putting up a very particular kind of beacon. There are a lot of constraints 
on exactly what sort of signal they are willing to send. This is the same as saying that their 
beacons have a lot of information content. From the geeks’ perspective, the exchange of this 
information is the whole point of setting up beacons, and the presence of friendly MOPs is just a
happy side effect.

But from the sociopaths’ perspective, these information-bearing constraints are mere shibboleths.
Chapman’s sociopaths will follow whatever rules they have to in order to pass as contributors to
the subculture, but they won’t put independent effort into understanding why these rules are the 
ones they have to follow. Instead, their contribution is to **iteratively improve the beacons’ 
ability to attract prey.**

As sociopaths test out variations in their beacons, they will learn which variants are best at 
attracting people, by means of trial and error. Three things about this will reduce the relative 
proportion of geeks in the subculture, and therefore the geeks’ influence.

1. First, since MOPs are less sensitive to fine variations in signal than geeks are, random
mutations in beacon design are more likely to attract more MOPs than more geeks.

2. Second, as the overall process becomes better at attracting MOPs, more sociopaths will notice
that it is a promising feeding ground.

3. Finally, many changes that are neutral or beneficial for attracting MOPs, will, from the geeks’ 
perspective, seem like the introduction of errors. This will make the signal less attractive to
geeks who have not already invested in the subculture.

What does this process look like from the geeks’ perspective?

At first - people are coming into the geeks’ subculture, and trying to contribute to it. These
newcomers are putting a lot of energy into creating new content, but from time to time 
introduce perplexing errors. But, they are getting a lot of people interested in this wonderful
information you’ve created, so the geeks are not inclined to complain. The MOPs basically trust
the geeks’ implied endorsement, and accept the new contributors on the same footing as the old 
ones.

But now there are two forces at play affecting the content of the signals being sent. One is a
force correcting errors - the geeks’ desire to preserve, transmit, and develop the original 
information-content of the signal. The other force introduces errors: the sociopaths’ desire to
attract more MOPs. When the second force becomes stronger than the first, the sociopaths are now 
the dominant faction, and able to coordinate to suppress geek attempts to correct errors that 
make the message more popular.

At first, the MOPs’ acceptance of the sociopaths depended in part on the geeks’ tacit endorsement.
But once a sufficiently powerful faction of sociopaths has been given social proof, they can wield
the force of disendorsement against the geeks. The only meaningful constraint is that MOPs don’t
like conflict, so the sociopaths will want to avoid escalating to a point where the conflict
becomes overt.

From the sociopaths’ perspective, the geeks were inexplicably donating their time and energy to 
discovering a new signal to broadcast, that would attract a pool of MOPs to feed on. But the geeks
were - again incomprehensibly - neither exploiting nor defending that resource. The sociopath 
strategy invests in general understanding of social dynamics, but does not need to understand the 
specific content of what the geeks are trying to do. The sociopath need only know that some
attention, money, volunteer hours, and social proof have been brought within reach of a competent
marketing and sales effort.

From the sociopaths' perspective, they are not introducing errors - they are correcting them.

The paradigmatic predator is sufficiently smarter than its targets to anticipate and manipulate
their behavior. But Chapman’s sociopaths follow a simple, information-poor strategy, that preys on
sophisticated, information-rich ones. This strategy doesn’t have to understand the signal as well 
as the geeks do - the geeks will help it pass their tests (because geeks are usually guess culture,
and guess culture screens for trying to cooperate). It simply iterates empirically towards shining 
the most attractive beacon it can, of a kind that has already been selected to attract its prey.

The predation strategy of Chapman’s sociopath is a strategy that predates on all information-
seeking behavior, whether competitive or cooperative.

Note that sociopaths aren't "bad":

```markdown
Sociopaths are not necessarily universally bad or mean people. They just *don't care about your 
project*. This is fine. You don't care about most people's projects. Likewise, most people don't 
care about yours. The problem is when you let those people run your project.

As far as Chapman's sociopaths know, they are just doing what one does to beacons - trying to make
them more pleasing to more people. They are cooperating with the geeks as sincerely as they know 
how - as sincerely as the believe to be possible. In many cases they simply don’t understand that
the original signal had value. There's little point in being indignant about this.
```

It's the "geeks" who're most responsible for maintaining that subculture, and for the creation of community standards:

```markdown
The people who need to do something about the corruption of a message are the people who *care
the most about that message*: the geeks. In subcultures following this lifecycle, geeks have 
committed a key sin: trying to get something for nothing, by pretending to be more popular than
we are.

People playing sociopath strategies gain a foothold in subcultures, because they *bring in more
resources*, get more people involved, get attention from respectable people, raise money - since 
they are paying attention to how attractive their beacons are, not whether they are correct 
(from a geek perspective).

The obvious strategy to counter this is to speak up early and often when errors are being 
introduced. It is not a sin to be error-tolerant, in the sense of not immediately expelling people 
for making errors. But it is *always* a sin, in an otherwise-cooperative community, to *suppress the
calling-out of errors*, in order to avoid making a scene, scaring off the MOPs, harming morale and
momentum. If you are a geek in that sort of subculture, the MOPs are relying on your implied 
endorsement of the other content-creators. If you remain silent in the face of error, then you are
*betraying this trust*. There is no additional error-correction system that will save you - you were
supposed to be the error-correction system.

If you and your collaborators diligently follow this practice, then this will enable the creation 
of common knowledge when someone is reliably introducing errors, and either failing to correct them
or making the minimum possible correction. You will have shared knowledge of track records - who is
introducing information, and who is destroying it with noise. It is only with this knowledge that 
you can begin to have actual community standards.
