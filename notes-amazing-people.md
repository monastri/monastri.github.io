## What is this?

This is the "amazing people" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

(There's also the parallel to [perpetual beta](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/running-code-and-perpetual-beta/) for web-based software: scaffolding for extensive ongoing experimentation within the already-deployed app. Never start, as Gwern says.)

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building.

### Donald Trump
([overview](#overview))

(I don't think DJT is amazing -- precisely the opposite. I just couldn't resist including the quotes below, and the only main category I have that's remotely related to people is this one.)

From Scott Alexander's [book review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/19/book-review-the-art-of-the-deal/) of DJT's *The Art of the Deal*, written in March 2016 before he became president. 

This quote contrasts DJT with Robert Cialdini of *Influence*:

```markdown
Trump is no psychology expert, but after a few months of attributing his victories to 
blind luck, most people have accepted Scott Adams’ hypothesis that he’s really a “master
persuader”. Salon, Daily Caller, Bill Maher, and the Economist all use the word “genius”.
The less you respect Trump’s substance – and I respect it very little – the more you’re 
forced to admire whatever combination of charisma, persuasion, and showmanship he uses 
to succeed without having any.
```

DJT thinks deal-making is an innate ability:

```markdown
More than anything else, I think deal-making is an ability you’re born with. It’s in the
genes…unlike the real estate evangelists you see all over television these days, I can’t
promise you that by following the precepts I’m about to offer you’ll become a millionaire 
overnight. Unfortunately, life rarely works that way, and most people who try to get rich
quick end up going broke instead.
```

DJT's "truthful hyperbole" tactic:

```markdown
One thing I’ve learned about the press is that they’re always hungry for a good story,
and the more sensational the better. It’s in the nature of the job, and I understand that.
The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do 
things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you…

The funny thing is that even a critical story, which may be hurtful personally, can be 
very valuable to your business. [When I announced my plans to build Television City to 
the press], not all of them liked the idea of the world’s tallest building. But the point
is that we got a lot of attention, and that alone creates value.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive 
them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves
into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to
frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone 
asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, 
I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, 
and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build
only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings.
I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting
unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I
also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may 
not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. 
That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the 
biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.

I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration – and a very effective
form of promotion.
```

DJT's tenth rule of deal-making is "having fun":

```markdown
I don’t kid myself. Life is very fragile, and success doesn’t change that. If anything,
success makes it more fragile. Anything can change, without warning, and that’s why I 
try not to take any of what’s happened too seriously. Money was never a big motivation 
for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game. I don’t
spend a lot of time worrying about what I should have done differently, or what’s going
to happen next. If you ask me exactly what the deals I’m about to describe all add up to
in the end, I’m not sure I have a very good answer. Except that I’ve had a very good 
time making them.
```

DJT's late-career-stage plans apparently involve giving back by having skin in the game:

```markdown
What’s next? Fortunately, I don’t know the answer, because if I did, that would take all
the fun out of it. This much I do know: it won’t be more of the same.

I’ve spent the first twenty years of my working life building, accumulating, and
accomplishing things that many said could not be done. The biggest challenge I see over 
the next twenty years is to figure out some creative ways to give back some of what I’ve 
gotten.

I don’t just mean money, although that’s part of it. It’s easy to be generous when you’ve 
got a lot, and anyone who does, should be. But what I admire most are people who put
themselves directly on the line. I’ve never been terribly interested in why people give, 
because their motivation is rarely what it seems to be, and it’s almost never pure altruism. 
To me, what matters is the doing, and giving time is far more valuable than just giving 
money.

In my life, there are two things I’ve found I’m very good at: overcoming obstacles and 
motivating good people to do their best work. One of the challenges ahead is how to use 
those skills as successfully in the service of others as I’ve done, up to now, on my own 
behalf.

Don’t get me wrong. I also plan to keep making deals, big deals, and right around the clock.
```

And this is the money quote that make me create this subsection in the first place -- DJT as autistic child with special interest in real estate development:

```markdown
So much for seventeen pages of business advice. The other three hundred forty-eight
pages are Trump gushing about the minutiae all of the interesting deals he’s been a 
part of.

“GUYS, YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS, THERE WAS THIS ONE SKYSCRAPER THAT WAS SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE A FLOOR TO AREA RATIO OF 6, BUT THEN I BEAT HILTON IN NEGOTIATING THE AIR RIGHTS 
FROM THE COMPANY NEXT DOOR, AND ACTIVATED AN OPTION TO BUY A PROPERTY ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF IT, AND ALL OF THAT LANDED ME A PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE OF THE BIG BANKS, AND THEN THE 
PLANNING BOARD TOTALLY CHANGED THE FLOOR AREA RATIO! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, GUYS??!”

Overall the effect was that of an infodump from an autistic child with a special interest
in real estate development, which was both oddly endearing and not-so-oddly very boring.
```

combined with this -- an answer to "what do real estate developers do?" The answer being "coordination, often via blatant lies":

```markdown
I started the book with the question: what exactly do real estate developers do? They
don’t design buildings; they hire an architect for that part. They don’t construct the 
buildings; they hire a construction company for that part. They don’t manage the buildings; 
they hire a management company for that part. They’re not even the capitalist who funds the 
whole thing; they get a loan from a bank for that. So what do they do? Why don’t you or I 
take out a $100 million loan from a bank, hire a company to build a $100 million skyscraper,
and then rent it out for somewhat more than $100 million and become rich?

As best I can tell, the developer’s job is coordination. This often means *blatant lies*.
The usual process goes like this: the bank would be happy to lend you the money as long as
you have guaranteed renters. The renters would be happy to sign up as long as you show them
a design. The architect would be happy to design the building as long as you tell them what
the government’s allowing. The government would be happy to give you your permit as long as 
you have a construction company lined up. And the construction company would be happy to 
sign on with you as long as you have the money from the bank in your pocket. Or some kind
of complicated multi-step catch-22 like that. The solution – or at least Trump’s solution – 
is to tell everybody that all the other players have agreed and the deal is completely done 
except for their signature. The trick is to lie to the right people in the right order, so 
that by the time somebody checks to see whether they’ve been conned, you actually do have 
the signatures you told them that you had. The whole thing sounds very stressful.

The developer’s other job is dealing with regulations. The way Trump tells it, there are so 
many regulations on development in New York City in particular and America in general that
erecting anything larger than a folding chair requires the full resources of a multibillion
dollar company and half the law firms in Manhattan. Once the government grants approval it’s 
likely to add on new conditions when you’re halfway done building the skyscraper, insist on
bizarre provisions that gain it nothing but completely ruin your chance of making a profit,
or just stonewall you for the heck of it if you didn’t donate to the right people’s campaigns
last year. Reading about the system makes me both grateful and astonished that any structures 
have ever been erected in the United States at all, and somewhat worried that if anything
ever happens to Donald Trump and a few of his close friends, the country will lose the 
ability to legally construct artificial shelter and we will all have to go back to living in 
caves.
```

The first part reminds me of this oft-forwarded joke (via Sharon Xu):

```markdown
I told my son, “You will marry the girl I choose.”
He said, “NO!”
I told him, “She is Bill Gates’ daughter.”
He said, “OK.”
I called Bill Gates and said, “I want your daughter to marry my son.”
Bill Gates said, “NO.”
I told Bill Gates, My son is the CEO of World Bank.”
Bill Gates said, “OK.”
I called the President of World Bank and asked him to make my son the CEO.
He said, “NO.”
I told him, “My son is Bill Gates’ son-in-law.”
He said, “OK.”
This is exactly how politics works...
```

The ice-rink success story:

```markdown
Trump’s greatest pride is his ability to construct things on time and under budget. He 
gives the story of an ice rink that New York City was trying to renovate in Central Park.
After six years and $13 million, the city had completely failed to renovate it and just 
made things worse. Trump offered as a charitable gesture to do it himself, and the mayor,
who was a political enemy, refused. The press hounded the mayor, Trump eventually was 
allowed to try, and he finished it in four months for only $2.5 million. He boasted that 
he finished fixing the rink in less time than it took the city to complete their study on
why their rink-fixing project had failed.
```

Analogizing DJT to sportsplayers where you can't (aren't interested in?) changing the rules, you just do your best within them:

```markdown
He had a couple more stories like this – but throughout all of it, there was a feeling of 
something missing. Here is a guy whose job is cutting through bureaucracy, and who is 
apparently quite good at it. Yet throughout the book – and for that matter, throughout his
campaign for the nomination of a party that makes cutting bureaucracy a big part of their 
platform – he doesn’t devote a lot of energy to expressing discontent with the system. 
There is no libertarian streak to Trump – in the process of successfully navigating all of
these terrible rules, he rarely takes a step back and wonders about a better world where 
these rules don’t exist. Despite having way more ability to change the system than most 
people, he seems to regard it as a given, not worth debating. I think back to his
description of how it’s all just a big game to him. Most star basketball players are too 
busy shooting hoops to imagine whether the game might be more interesting if a three-
pointer was worth five points, or whatever. Trump seems to have the same attitude – the 
rules are there; his job is to make the best deal he can within those rules.

Maybe I’m imagining things, but I feel like this explains a lot about his presidential 
campaign. People ask him something like “How would you fix Medicare?”, and he gives some
vapid answer like “There are tremendous problems with Medicare, but I’m going to hire the
best people. I know all of the best doctors and health care executives, and we’re going 
to cut some amazing deals and have the best Medicare in the world.” And yeah, he did say
in his business tips that you should change the frame to avoid being negative to reporters.
But this isn’t a negative or a gotcha question. At some point you’d expect Trump to do his
homework and get some kind of Medicare plan or other. Instead he just goes off on the same
few tangents. This thing about hiring the best people, for example, seems almost like an 
obsession in the book. But it works for him. When somebody sues him (which seems like an 
hourly occurrence in real estate development no matter how careful you are) his response is
to find the best lawyer, hire them, and throw them at the problem. When he needs a hotel 
managed, he hires the best hotel managers and tells them to knock themselves out. Even his
much-mocked tendency to talk about all the people he knows comes from this being a big part
of his real estate strategy – one of the reasons he can outcompete other tycoons is because
he knows people on the planning board, knows people in the banks, knows people in all the 
companies he works with. It’s a huge advantage for him.

These strategies have always worked for him before, and floating off into some intellectual
ideal-system-design effort has never worked for him before. So when he says that he’s going
to solve Medicare by hiring great managers and knowing all the right people, I don’t think 
this is some vapid way of avoiding the question. I think it’s the honest output of a mind 
that works very differently from mine. I’ve been designing ideal systems of government for 
the heck of it ever since I was old enough to realize what a government was. Trump is at 
serious risk of actually taking over a government, and such design still doesn’t appeal to
him. The best he can do is say that other people are bad at governing, but he’s going to be
good at governing, on account of his deal-making skill. I think he honestly believes this. 
It makes perfect sense in real estate, where some people are good businesspeople, others are
bad businesspeople, and the goal is to game the system rather than change it. But in politics,
it’s easy to interpret as authoritarianism – “Forget about policy issues, I’m just going to
steamroll through this whole thing by being personally strong and talented.”
```

"The world is taken as a given; it contains deals" -- DJT a la narrow-but-powerful optimization process:

```markdown
I said it before, but it bears repeating – this book has a really good ghostwriter. Yeah, it
comes across as narcissistic; there’s probably no way to avoid that in a Trump autobiography.
But Donald Trump’s interest in Donald Trump pales beside his blazing hot interest in the sheer
awesomeness of hotel property deals. And part of me wants to say that people with obsessive 
interests in bizarre things are My Kind Of People.

But there’s still something alien about Trump here, even moreso than with the populist 
demagogue of the campaign trail. Trump the demagogue is attacked as anti-intellectual. I get
anti-intellectualism because – like all isms – it’s an intellectual idea, and I tend to think
in those terms. But Trump of the book is more a-intellectual, in the same way some people are
amoral or asexual. The world is taken as a given. It contains deals. Some people make the 
deals well, and they are winners. Other people make the deals poorly, and they are losers.
Trump does not need more than this. There will be no civilization of philosopher-Trumps asking
where the first deal came from, or whether a deal is a deal only by virtue of its participation
in some primordial deal beyond material existence. Trump’s world is so narrow it’s hard to fit
your head inside it, so narrow that on contact with any wider world it seems strange and 
attenuated, a broken record of deals and connections and hirings expanding to fill the space 
available.

### Jeremy Bentham
([overview](#overview))

I found [this FB post by Rikk Hill](https://www.facebook.com/rikkhill/posts/10155063688827423) entirely at random, made the *very* lucky step of saving it all in a Word doc somewhere within the bowels of my laptop, and then forgot nearly everything about it except the strong sense that Jeremy Bentham was important to utilitarianism and weird EA because of his thinking style. I forgot *so much* about it that I couldn't find it back after concerted searching, all my search terms being wrong; in fact, it was only today that I realized I even had the Word doc, from which I could later retrieve the original source. That was a deeply frustrating experience. Not all of these experiences have a similarly happy ending; indeed this was an exception. This class of experiences is in fact one of *the* main drivers behind the existence of this entire sprawling document. 

But I digress. Anyway:

It was really, deeply important that Jeremy Bentham's thinking was weird, as a side effect of being utterly, undeviatingly principled; in that sense he was the first weird EAist, decades and centuries ahead of his time. (For more on weird EA see [here](#weird-EA)). Also, rereading Rikk's post made me think of [Scott on Robin Hanson](#robin-hanson). Robin may well be the Bentham of our time. 

Last point before we dive in: Bentham, like Hanson, and like myself (except for the part where I don't have any intellectual output), is an inveterate [sequence thinker](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/); most people are cluster thinkers, and there is a lot of value in that as well (chiefly sandboxing weird conclusions from dominating via calculations).

Here's Rikk's post in full.

```markdown
I’d like to talk a little bit about moral philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and why he has a 
weird level of celebrity status among people who think like I do.

Jeremy Bentham lived in the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, in what we think of as the 
mid-late Georgian era. That’s important. This is the period in which Jane Austen wrote all 
her novels. The global policy issue of the era was motivating the abolition of the 
international slave trade. 3% of the population of England and Wales had the right to vote. 
Over this period, the Industrial and Agricultural revolutions in Britain mean that instead 
of 45% of the labour force working in agriculture, a mere 22% of the labour force was
required for feeding the nation. At the time, using just under a quarter of your working
population to produce enough food was seen as nothing short of a miracle. Today, this number
is less than 1%.

He lived in a very different time, is what I’m saying. I can’t stress this enough. It’s 
desperately important to remember this when thinking about Jeremy Bentham, because his 
intellectual output is principally characterised by being 

(a) utterly batshit, and 
(b) shockingly, eerily, uncannily ahead of its time.

Let’s deal with the batshit stuff first. Jeremy Bentham was a wildly eccentric dude, perhaps
best demonstrated by the fact that I used to walk past his corpse every day. It sits in a 
glass case in University College London. He instructed that after his death, his body should
be dissected for medical science, and afterwards, his taxidermied corpse should be put on 
display. He called this an “auto-icon”; why build a statue to someone when you can just 
exhibit their body? If you’re around Fitzrovia on a weekday, you can pop in and see it.

He thought the social mores and taboos of his time were arbitrary or unhelpful or outright 
wrong, and the social mores and taboos around death and the dead were just one example of this.
In later life, he became fixated on the role of bodies after death, and suggested decorating
public spaces with mummified corpses instead of trees. He also shared his bed with the pig he
kept as a house pet, pioneered a form of jogging (which he called “ante-prandial 
circumgyration”), and maintained largely-unsolicited correspondence with different heads of 
state from all over the world on the subjects of legal and constitutional reform.

Some of this is to be expected. If you reject the norms of your time and try to re-derive the 
social order from first principles, you might end up spooning a pig and writing to the President
of the United States about codifying the common law. What you might *also* end up doing is
independently inventing much of 21st Century Western liberalism, which is what Bentham also did.

There is a sense in which Jeremy Bentham literally invented a lot of the concepts we take for
granted as the founder of utilitarianism and a prolific Enlightenment thinker, but there is 
another sense in which, almost as a side-effect, he came to a variety of conclusions about the
social order which wouldn’t gain widespread traction until decades or even centuries after his
death. Universal suffrage, sexual equality, decriminalisation of homosexuality, abolition of 
the death penalty, animal welfare, no-fault divorce… the list of stuff which he essentially 
inferred from first principles yet ran strongly counter to the prevailing cultural norms is 
striking.

He was notoriously bad at getting his work published, and almost all of what he wrote had to be
collated and published posthumously by friends and proteges. A lot of editorial work went into 
making these works acceptable to the public, to the point where his defence of homosexuality 
didn’t come to light until 1931, over a century after he wrote it.

Many of the ideas he advocated have been part of the society we all grew up in for so long that
we don’t even recognise them as active choices of how our society is organised, but others are 
weirdly specific contemporary progressive ideas. For example, he very specifically drew attention
to sexual promiscuity of women as being judged disproportionately harshly compared to that of men.
He claimed there were other norms, such as sexual fidelity, that undercut any harms that might
result from sexual promiscuity, and shaming women on the basis of their sexual appetite just 
harmed everybody. This is a point that contemporary feminists are still having to make two 
centuries later. With a few small tweaks, a lot of what he wrote on sexuality could have come 
straight out of a contemporary discussion on sex-positivity. A reminder: he was writing this at 
about the same time Jane Austen was writing Mansfield Park.

I am going somewhere with this. I’m not just yammering on about how cool I think Jeremy Bentham 
is. So here we go. Here we get to the point of this little rant.

Treating everything you know about the world as suspect and trying to reason about it from as 
small a set of assumptions as possible is, to my mind, one of the fundamental tools of analytical
thought. Not everyone agrees with me on this. There is a particularly annoying strand of post-
cultural-turn thought which rears its head whenever I try this in public. “What’s that?” it’ll
say, “you’re trying to infer objectively-grounded facts about the universe? Well you *can’t*, you
naive silly sausage, because whether you like it or not, you’re in a *culture*, and that culture 
permeates your entire conception of reality, and you can’t ever really know anything, so there!” 
Then it sits there, like a cat that’s inordinately smug about what it’s just dropped in the litter
box.

I’m not *entirely* unsympathetic to this idea. We are a product of the culture we’re raised in.
It would be silly to think that if I grew up 12th Century Saxony or early Imperial China that I
would have the same moral and political sensibilities that I do now. I would probably believe 
what most other people in those times and places believed. Given that, maybe it is unreasonable
to think that I can somehow discard the biases of my own culture.

But then I look at Jeremy Bentham, who, at a time when the morality of chattel-slavery was still
a hotly-debated topic, was saying that It’s Okay to Be Gay and we shouldn’t slut-shame. Throw in
a Belle and Sebastian album and an animated gif of a puppy fighting it’s own reflection, and he 
could be on Tumblr.

Jeremy Bentham’s method is my method. My justification for progressive liberalism comes from
starting at the same premises he started at and playing them forward. It’s phenomenally easier for
me to do that than it was for Jeremy Bentham, because we’ve had 200 years of progress and I’m 
surrounded by other people who have the same set of object-level beliefs as I do. Those people 
are happy to support this method when it’s advocating LGBT+ rights and sex-positivity, but if it
delivers anything from left-field, that’s when the knives come out.

Here is a radical proposition: Jeremy Bentham wasn’t just ahead of his time — he was ahead of *our*
time. This was definitely true as recently as 1967 when homosexuality was decriminalised in the UK.
Maybe in another hundred years we’ll all be taking our pigs for an ante-prandial circumgyration 
along a row of mummified corpses. Taking a less facetious tack, over half of his writings have 
never been published. Who knows what he wrote which we would find bizarre today but which our great-
grandchildren wouldn’t bat an eyelid at.

More generally, maybe you can’t have the visionary foresight without the eccentricity. Even among
progressive people, who pay a lot of lip-service to celebrating diversity, there is a surprising 
amount of hostility to weird nerds re-deriving the social order from first principles. When we’re
judging people for doing this, maybe we should remember Jeremy Bentham. Perhaps this method has 
more value than meets the eye.

### Srinivasa Ramanujan
([overview](#overview))

From JE Littlewood's review of “The Collected Papers of Srinivasa Ramanujan”:

```markdown
…the most important of [Ramanujan’s methods] were completely original. His intuition worked in
analogies, sometimes, remote, and to an astonishing extent by empirical induction from particular
numerical cases. …his most important weapon seems to have been a highly elaborate technique of 
transformation by means of divergent series and integrals … He had no strict logical justification
for his operations. He was not interested in rigour, which for that matter is not of first-rate 
importance in analysis beyond the undergraduate stage, and can be supplied, given a real idea, by
any competent professional. The clear-cut idea of what is *meant* by a proof, nowadays so familiar
as to be taken for granted, he perhaps did not possess at all. If a significant piece of reasoning
occurred somewhere, and the total mixture of evidence and intuition gave him certainty, he looked 
no further. It is a minor indication of his quality that he can never have *missed* Cauchy’s
theorem. With it he could have arrived more rapidly and conveniently at certain of his results, 
but his own methods enabled him to survey the field with an equal comprehensiveness and as sure a 
grasp.

### Richard Feynman
([overview](#overview))

A lot of great quotes from Danny Hillis' retrospective of [his experiences with Dick](http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/). I'll try not to quote the entire essay. 

How they met, and how Dick agreed to help Danny & Co. work on the million-processor Connection Machine:

```markdown
One day when I was having lunch with Richard Feynman, I mentioned to him that I was planning
to start a company to build a parallel computer with a million processors. His reaction was 
unequivocal, "That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard." For Richard a crazy idea was
an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By 
the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.

Richard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the 
"computers," that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was
instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical
simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl,
began studying computers at MIT.

I got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to
design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we 
envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network.
We called it a "Connection Machine." Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed
the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I 
visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the
planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build
it was the lunchtime meeting.
```

Funny anecdote:

```markdown
Richard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the 
money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the
city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few 
million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were
arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, 
"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?" The assembled group of not-
quite-graduated MIT students was astounded.

After a hurried private discussion ("I don't know, you hired him..."), we informed Richard that his
assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems.

"That sounds like a bunch of baloney," he said. "Give me something real to do."

So we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the
machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor 
to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying 
pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router.
```

The router problem:

```markdown
The router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to
communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. 
Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a 
million processors would require $10^{12}$ wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in
a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. 
Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same
wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it 
couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard 
Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently.

During those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were
objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but 
fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of 
the circuits with pencil and paper. ...

The technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to 
simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do
was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a
router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, 
devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the
boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In
retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we
never would have started.
```

Solving the router problem the physicist's way -- PDEs instead of discrete math:

```markdown
By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the 
router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of 
partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer,
treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. 
Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as
"the average number of 1 bits in a message address." I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis
in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of "the number of 1's" 
with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's
equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.

The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up
against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way 
to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's 
equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking
better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers.

Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program
run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life.
```

Dick's "Los Alamos" Great Reference Point, and "Let's Get Organized":

```markdown
I had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered 
to help out. "We've got to get these guys organized," he told me. "Let me tell you how we did it
at Los Alamos."

Every great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use 
as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were 
accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever 
things got "cockeyed," Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than
then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance
in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the "group leader" in 
this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos.

Part Two of Feynman's "Let's Get Organized" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar 
series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's
idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less
conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John 
Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural 
networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some 
people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at
Thinking Machines Corporation.

What Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an [associative memory], a device for 
remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such 
as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is 
able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter "A" 
will "remind" the memory of another "A" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how
such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons.

Not only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine.
Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons,
with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of 
the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with
100% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional 
computer.
```

Dick's love for detail:

```markdown
Concentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach.
He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual
gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction.
He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years 
later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for [Scientific American], he
was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, "How is anyone supposed to know that
this isn't just a bunch of crap?"

Feynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for
numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the 
Connection Machine would not be efficient at "number-crunching," because the first prototype had no
special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were "known" to be
requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was
familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics.

Quantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons.
Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical 
quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic
that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation
is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution
involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on 
the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a 
Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution
of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the 
lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these
multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 
processors busy.

To find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD.
Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel
version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast 
it would run on the Connection Machine.

He was excited by the results. "Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of
yours can actually do something [useful]!" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection 
Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine
that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and
more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine.
```

Dick's attitude towards explanations:

```markdown
In the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with
cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams
and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this,

"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the
individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of
water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to 
invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is
a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these
particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids."

This was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had
worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had
solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real
understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality.

We tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical
presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the
Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence 
critique of the planned presentation. "Don't say `reflected acoustic wave.' Say [echo]." Or, "Forget
all that `local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake
it out." Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated.
```

Dick hated being asked for advice, and would often say "not my department":

```markdown
Getting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on 
any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was
asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with "That's not my department." I could never figure out 
just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working
on those "not-my-department" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he
would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, "I've been thinking about what you asked the
other day and it seems to me..." This worked best if you were careful not to expect it.

I do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the "dirty work." In fact, he was always
volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel 
Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to
hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when 
Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he
understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when
a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish 
your question was, he never made you feel like a fool.
```

I do this too! "What's the simplest example", etc, albeit at a lot lower level:

```markdown
As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of
the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, 
biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible
to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding
of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do.

For Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic
questions like, "What is the simplest example?" or "How can you tell if the answer is right?" He asked
questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve.
Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the
middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. "Don't bug me. I'm busy," he would
say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he
lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to
anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, 
protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms.
```

Retracing experts as amateurs, a quote I also really relate to -- this one on punctuated equilibrium:

```markdown
The last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that
simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of 
generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden
leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real 
biological evolution might also exhibit such "punctuated equilibrium," so Richard and I decided to look
more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with
him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck
equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the 
subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our "discoveries" were covered in the first few pages.
When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. "Hey, we got it right!" he said.
"Not bad for amateurs."

In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. 
In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing.
But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. 
It was amateurs who made the progress.

### Robin Hanson
([overview](#overview))

Robin may well be [the Bentham of our time](#jeremy-bentham).

Scott Alexander, writing about Robin in his book review [Age of Em](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/28/book-review-age-of-em/):

```markdown
There are some people who are destined to become adjectives. Pick up a David Hume book you’ve 
never read before and it’s easy to recognize the ideas and style as Humean. Everything Tolkien
wrote is Tolkienesque in a non-tautological sense. This isn’t meant to denounce either writer 
as boring. Quite the opposite. They produced a range of brilliant and diverse ideas. But there
was a hard-to-define and very consistent ethos at the foundation of both. Both authors were 
*very much like themselves.*

Robin Hanson is more like himself than anybody else I know. He’s obviously brilliant – a PhD in
economics, a masters in physics, work for DARPA, Lockheed, NASA, George Mason, and the Future of
Humanity Institute. But his greatest aptitude is in being really, really Hansonian.

Bryan Caplan describes it as well as anybody:

*When the typical economist tells me about his latest research, my standard reaction is ‘Eh, maybe.’
Then I forget about it. When Robin Hanson tells me about his latest research, my standard reaction 
is ‘No way! Impossible!’ Then I think about it for years.*

This is my experience too. I think I said my first “No way! Impossible!” sometime around 2008 after
reading his blog Overcoming Bias. Since then he’s influenced my thinking more than almost anyone
else I’ve ever read. When I heard he was writing a book, I was – well, I couldn’t even imagine a
book by Robin Hanson. When you read a thousand word blog post by Robin Hanson, you have to sit down 
and think about it and wait for it to digest and try not to lose too much sleep worrying about it.
A whole book would be *something.*
```

Redditor and English professor u/werttrew's [A Robin Hanson primer](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3sjtar/a_robin_hanson_primer/) has a nice summary of his main ideas. He has this flattering remark:

```markdown
I think Hanson is important not necessarily because he’s always right but because he provides some
startling and fresh ways of looking how the world works. I can probably safely attest that my 
thinking of the world is heavily influenced by his ideas. (I am an English professor, and I find
myself talking about Hanson’s ideas in my classes more often Weber or Foucault or Freud any other
thinker).
```

u/werttrew talks about Robin's "inductive style":

```markdown
Robin tends to work inductively—big idea speculated first, then thought-experiments as to how it 
would reveal itself. Like many economists, for better or worse Robin tends to work with interpretive
frameworks that cannot be falsified empirically. This means that economic models do not always have
the epistemic status of models in the physical sciences, which can be falsified through experiments.

TheZvi commenting on Scott's post [Does age bring wisdom?](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/07/does-age-bring-wisdom/):

```markdown
Happy birthday, indeed. Since no one else seems to have pointed it out yet, let me state
what seems to me to be completely obvious, which is that #2 is a load of bull.

You are special. You can and do change the world.

I’m not saying that to the proverbial/general you; this isn’t a “everyone is beautiful in
every single way” thing, or a “anyone can change the world” pep talk. This is a “You are
Scott Alexander and you have a voice and platform that actually matters” pep talk. People
really do actually listen to you. People who matter. Your opinions filter in to the general
discussion. I’m not talking only about rationalists or people in Berkeley, I’m talking
about people like Tyler Cohen and Ezra Klein. If I had to list “blogs/people everyone in
my office reads that aren’t explicitly about our work” you’d be on the list at #3 behind
Tyler Cohen and Matt Levine.

Maybe 10 years ago it would have been reasonable to say that you (probably) weren’t special
and couldn’t change the world. But why would you believe that less now rather than more? 
You’ve actually already changed it, and mostly for the better. So when you notice you’re 
doing things that quash truth, or worse encourage others to quash or disregard truth for 
other values (as you’ve done recently and explicitly), you’re not just fitting in. You’re
doing real, sizable harm. Snap out of it.

Act like you matter. Because you do.

In general, it seems like you’re making the mistake of thinking that because there are
hidden/complex reasons behind the things people do, and you’ve seen some of those reasons
but not others, and at least some of those reasons are good reasons, that this means that 
there’s a good reason for most (seemingly dumb) things people do and believe. No. A reason,
or even worse an explanation, does not mean a good reason!

Anyway, that’s what I have time for right now, except the reminder that yes Facebook is
ruining everything and seriously you have all the information and know full well that 
it’s true, and implying that it isn’t true by associating it with low-status in the form 
of an old-person stereotype really isn’t helping.

### Jeff Bezos
([overview](#overview))

As we should, we'll start with the legendary Steve Yegge [giant brain post](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/AaygmbzVeRq) on Google+ (which sadly no longer exists):

```markdown
**Amazon War Story #1:  Jeff Bezos**

Over the years I watched people give presentations to Jeff Bezos and come back bruised: 
emotionally, intellectually, often career-ily.  If you came back with a nod or a signoff,
you were jumping for joy.  Presenting to Jeff is a gauntlet that tends to send people 
back to the cave to lick their wounds and stay out of the sunlight for a while.

I say “presentations” and you probably think PowerPoint, but no:  he outlawed PowerPoint
there many years ago.  It’s not allowed on the campus.  If you present to Jeff, you write
it as prose.

One day it came time for me to present to Jeff.  It felt like... I don’t know, maybe how
they swarm around you when you’re going to meet the President.  People giving you last-
minute advice, wishing you luck, ushering you past regiments of admins and security guards.
It’s like you’re in a movie.  A gladiator movie.

Fortunately I’d spent years watching Jeff in action before my turn came, and I had prepared
in an unusual way.  My presentation -- which, roughly speaking was about the core skills a
generalist engineer ought to know -- was a resounding success.  He loved it.  Afterwards 
everyone was patting me on the back and congratulating me like I’d just completed a game-
winning hail-mary pass or something.  One VP told me privately:  “Presentations with Jeff
never go that well.”

But here’s the thing:  I had already suspected Jeff was going to like my presentation. 
You see, I had noticed two things about him, watching him over the years, that others had
either not caught on to, or else they had not figured out how to make the knowledge actionable.

Here is how I prepared.  Amazon people, take note.  This will help you.  I am dead serious.

To prepare a presentation for Jeff, first make damn sure you know everything there is to know
about the subject. Then write a prose narrative explaining the problem and solution(s).   
Write it exactly the way you would write it for a leading professor or industry expert on the
subject.

That is:  assume he already knows *everything* about it.  Assume he knows more than you do
about it.  Even if you have groundbreakingly original ideas in your material, just pretend it’s
old hat for him.  Write your prose in the succinct, direct, no-explanations way that you would 
write for a world-leading expert on the material.

You’re almost done.  The last step before you’re ready to present to him is this:  
*Delete every third paragraph.*

Now you’re ready to present!

Back in the mid-1800s there was this famous-ish composer/pianist named Franz Liszt.  He is
widely thought to have been the greatest sight-reader who ever lived.  He could sight-read
*anything* you gave him, including crazy stuff not even written for piano, like opera scores.
He was so staggeringly good at sight-reading that his brain was only fully engaged on the first
run-through.  After that he’d get bored and start embellishing with his own additions.

Bezos is so goddamned smart that you have to turn it into a game for him or he’ll be bored and
annoyed with you.  That was my first realization about him.  Who knows how smart he was before 
he became a billionaire -- let’s just assume it was “really frigging smart”, since he did build 
Amazon from scratch.  But for years he’s had armies of people taking care of *everything* for
him.  He doesn’t have to do anything at all except dress himself in the morning and read 
presentations all day long.  So he’s really, REALLY good at reading presentations.  He’s like the
Franz Liszt of sight-reading presentations.

So you have to start tearing out whole paragraphs, or even pages, to make it interesting for him.
He will fill in the gaps himself without missing a beat.  And his brain will have less time to
get annoyed with the slow pace of your brain.

I mean, imagine what it would be like to start off as an incredibly smart person, arguably a first-
class genius, and then somehow wind up in a situation where you have a general’s view of the 
industry battlefield for ten years.  Not only do you have more time than anyone else, and access
to more information than anyone else, you also have this long-term eagle-eye perspective that only
a handful of people in the world enjoy.

In some sense you wouldn’t even be human anymore.  People like Jeff are better regarded as hyper-
intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs.

But how do you prepare a presentation for a giant-brained alien?  Well, here’s my second realization:
He *will* outsmart you.  Knowing everything about your subject is only a first-line defense for you.
It’s like armor that he’ll eat through in the first few minutes.  He is going to have at least one 
deep insight about the subject, right there on the spot, and it’s going to make you look like a 
complete buffoon.

Trust me folks, I saw this happen time and again, for *years*.  Jeff Bezos has all these incredibly
intelligent, experienced domain experts surrounding him at huge meetings, and on a daily basis he 
thinks of shit that they never saw coming.  It’s a guaranteed facepalm fest.

So I knew he was going to think of something that I hadn’t.  I didn’t know what it might be, because
I’d spent weeks trying to think of everything.  I had reviewed the material with *dozens* of people.
But it didn’t matter.  I knew he was going to blindside me, because that’s what happens when you 
present to Jeff.

If you assume it’s coming, then it’s not going to catch you quite as off-guard.

And of course it happened.  I forgot Data Mining.  Wasn’t in the list.  He asked me point-blank, 
very nicely:  “Why aren’t Data Mining and Machine Learning in this list?”  And I laughed right in 
his face, which sent a shock wave through the stone-faced jury of VPs who had been listening in 
silence, waiting for a cue from Jeff as to whether he was going to be happy or I was headed for the
salt mines.

I laughed because I was *delighted*.  He’d caught me with my pants down around my ankles, right in 
front of everyone, despite all my excruciating weeks of preparation.  I had even deleted about a third
of the exposition just to keep his giant brain busy, but it didn’t matter.  He’d done it again, and I
looked like a total ass-clown in front of everyone.  It was frigging awesome.

So yeah, of course I couldn’t help laughing.  And I said:  “Yup, you got me.  I don’t know why it’s not
in there.  It should be.  I’m a dork.  I’ll add it.”  And he laughed, and we moved on, and everything 
was great.  Even the VPs started smiling.  It annoyed the hell out of me that they’d had to wait for a 
cue, but whatever.  Life was good.

You have to understand:  most people were scared around Bezos because they were waaaay too worried about
trying to keep their jobs.  People in high-level positions sometimes have a little too much personal 
self-esteem invested in their success.  Can you imagine how annoying it must be for him to be around 
timid people all day long?  But me -- well, I thought I was going to get fired every single day.  So 
fuck timid.  Might as well aim high and go out in a ball of flame.

That’s where the “Dread Pirate Bezos” line came from.  I worked hard and had fun, but every day I honestly
worried they might fire me in the morning.  Sure, it was a kind of paranoia.  But it was sort of healthy
in a way.  I kept my resume up to date, and I kept my skills up to date, and I never worried about saying
something stupid and ruining my career.  Because hey, they were most likely going to fire me in the morning.
```

And this one is from his legendary [platforms rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611):

```markdown
But there's one thing they (Amazon) do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL 
of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups.

Jeff Bezos is an infamous micro-manager. He micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon's
retail site. He hired Larry Tesler, Apple's Chief Scientist and probably the very most famous
and respected human-computer interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored every
goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry finally -- wisely -- left the company.
Larry would do these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any shred of doubt that 
nobody can understand that frigging website, but Bezos just couldn't let go of those pixels,
all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the landing page. They were like millions of
his own precious children. So they're all still there, and Larry is not.

Micro-managing isn't that third thing that Amazon does better than us, by the way. I mean, 
yeah, they micro-manage really well, but I wouldn't list it as a strength or anything. I'm 
just trying to set the context here, to help you understand what happened. We're talking about
a guy who in all seriousness has said on many public occasions that people should be paying 
him to work at Amazon. He hands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding 
people "who runs the company" when they disagree with him. The guy is a regular... well, Steve
Jobs, I guess. Except without the fashion or design sense. Bezos is super smart; don't get me
wrong. He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.
```

Khe Hy is [far more reverent](https://radreads.co/weis-wisdom-jeff-bezos-on-leadership-and-business-strategy/) of Bezos. The following all come from Eugene Wei, whose blog [Remains of the Day](https://www.eugenewei.com/) is also pretty great. 

Compression as a form of business leverage:

```markdown
He understood that you had to do a good job of encapsulating company strategy in a succinct 
and memorable way because the company was just so large and sprawling that it was so easy for
the message to dissipate as it traveled from person to person. He did a good job of encoding
the message and using rituals to ensure that the message was always emphasized.
```

Encoding a message:

```markdown
Amazon had different themes for different years [like in Infinite Jest]. One year, we had studied
different companies in history and discovered that at $1 Bn in revenue companies go sideways or 
topple over due to scaling. Jeff was conscious of heading that off. We had a year called “Getting 
our House in Order” and the acronym was G.O.H.I.O. There was a contest to name the year and this 
was the most memorable name. You ask anyone at Amazon who was there at that year and they’ll say 
“Oh there was that year of G.O.H.I.O. with a concrete set of projects.” You go to most companies 
today and ask them, what’s our theme this year and they’ll have no idea. It seems silly to have a
contest to name a theme, but it really hit home with every group of the company. You’d have that 
repeated at every meeting.
```

The power of rituals:

```markdown
An example of a ritual was that Jeff was worried that in organizations, as they get larger, they 
get slower moving. People spot problems but don’t feel the same impulse to fix a problem as they 
did when it was a small company. We had an award called the “Just Do It” Award and he’d announce 
it at every all-hands meetings, he’d give out any number of awards. And you could nominate people 
for this. And the rule was that it was something that you did on your own, without asking for 
permission, it didn’t have to work. You just spotted a problem, you tried to tackle it in some
way. And you would get a single Nike shoe on a plaque. That was just reinforcing the idea that
“Hey, we’re a culture that constantly tries to spot and fix problems.”
```

Bezos separating the company from the business:

```markdown
He was very good at separating the company from the business. The company is Amazon, a bunch 
of capabilities, people, organizations and processes and then there’s Amazon.com the retail 
business and he knew that these were two separate things. You had to work at the organism of
the organization and the culture, processes. And sometimes you had to think about basic business
strategy at Amazon.com. We’re very attached to a model of the tech CEO as a “product visionary,”
the Steve Jobs model of rolling up your sleeves, nitpicking the product details; we probably
underestimate Steve Jobs the company-builder.
```

Eugene Wei, whose blog [Remains of the Day](https://www.eugenewei.com/) is just great in general, has a post called [Compress to impress](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/5/11/jpeg-your-ideas) (URL: "JPEG your ideas") that pithily captures and expounds on a bunch of stuff I've vaguely thought about and seen elsewhere. I covered the quotables [here](#Dealing-with-message-distortion); this is just about Jeff himself. 

Eugene:

```markdown
Jeff understood the power of rhetoric. Time spent coming up with the right words to package 
a key concept in a memorable way was time well spent. People fret about what others say about
them when they're not in the room, but Jeff was solving the issue of getting people to say 
what he'd say when he wasn't in the room.

It was so important to him that we even had company-wide contests to come up with the most 
memorable ways to name our annual themes. ...

I have a list of dozens of Jeff sayings filed away in memory, and I'm not alone. It's one 
reason he's one of the world's most effective CEO's. What's particularly impressive is that
Jeff is so brilliant that it would be easy for him to state his thinking in complex ways that
us mere mortals wouldn't grok. But true genius is stating the complex simply.

Ironically, Jeff employs the reverse of this for his own information inflows. It's well known
that he banned Powerpoint at Amazon because he was increasingly frustrated at the lossy nature
that medium. As Edward Tufte has long railed against, Powerpoint encourage people to reduce 
their thinking to a series of bullet points. Whenever someone would stand up in front of Jeff
to present, Jeff would have rifled through to the end of the presentation before they would've 
finished a handful of slides, and Jeff would just jump in and start asking questions about 
slide 35 when someone was still talking to slide 3.

As a hyper intelligent person, Jeff didn't want lossy compression or lazy thinking, he wanted
the raw feed in a structured form, and so we all shifted to writing our arguments out as essays
that he'd read silently in meetings. Written language is a lossy format, too, but it has the 
advantage of being less forgiving of broken logic flows than slide decks.

To summarize, Jeff's outbound feedback was carefully encoded and compressed for maximum fidelity
of transmission across hundreds of thousands of employees all over the world, but his inbound 
data feed was raw and minimally compressed. In structure, this pattern resembles what a great 
designer or photographer does. Find the most elegant and stable output from a complex universe 
of inputs.
```

This agrees with Steve Yegge's funny quotes above.

<a name="#Andrey-Kolmogorov"></a>
### Andrey Kolmogorov
([overview](#overview))

Andrey Kolmogorov was the (only slightly) poorer man's version of [Johnny von Neumann](#johnny-von-neumann). He was born in 1903, eight months earlier than von Neumann, but lived thirty years longer. Von Neumann was only nineteen when he published two major math papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, superseding Cantor’s definition; that same year Kolmogorov wrote a paper on operations on sets which was a major generalization of results obtained by Suslin, then gained international prominence for constructing a Fourier series that diverges almost everywhere, something experts considered wholly unexpected. 

Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold:

```markdown
Almost simultaneously [Kolmogorov] exhibited his interest in a number of other areas of classical 
analysis: in problems of differentiation and integration, in measures of sets etc. In every one of his
papers, dealing with such a variety of topics, he introduced an element of originality, a breadth of 
approach, and a depth of thought.
```

He published eight papers in 1925 alone, all written while he was still an undergrad at MSU, and by the time he received his doctorate in 1929 Kolmogorov already had 18 papers to his name.

The 1930s were the mathematical heydays of both von Neumann and Kolmogorov. The latter in particular published over sixty papers during that decade alone in at least *eleven* different fields:

```markdown
… probability theory, projective geometry, mathematical statistics, the theory of functions of a real 
variable, topology, mathematical logic, mathematical biology, philosophy and the history of mathematics.
```

He was only thirty when he published Foundations of the Theory of Probability, laying the modern axiomatic foundations of probability theory and establishing his reputation as the world's leading expert in this field, and in the process bringing respectability to a discipline suffering from lack of foundations.

Like that of von Neumann, Kolmogorov’s work covered every area of mathematics except number theory. A non-exhaustive list of areas he enriched by his fundamental research:

```markdown
The theory of trigonometric series, measure theory, set theory, the theory of integration, constructive
logic (intuitionism), topology, approximation theory, probability theory, the theory of random processes, 
information theory, mathematical statistics, dynamical systems, automata theory, theory of algorithms, 
mathematical linguistics, turbulence theory, celestial mechanics, differential equations, Hilbert's 6th 
and 13th problems, ballistics, and applications of mathematics to problems of biology, geology, and the
crystallization of metals.
```

Kolmogorov was clearly a giant of a mathematical scientist in the highest sense of the word, so much so that I wonder why he didn’t have von Neumann’s reputation for brains. My best guess is that he wasn’t a mental calculator like von Neumann. The easiest way to *viscerally* demonstrate “wow brains!” is to do the sort of party tricks von Neumann used to regale his audience with—out-calculating (early) computers, instantly summing infinite series, translating books by heart “with no diminution in speech rate”, memorizing entire pages from phone books on command and suchlike—which Kolmogorov probably didn’t do.

<a name="#charlie-fefferman"></a>
### Charlie Fefferman
([overview](#overview))

I've known about Charles Fefferman for a few years now, but never really bothered to check out his background. I vaguely thought of him as Terry Tao before Terry Tao: both work in analysis, both are extremely accomplished and productive (Tao probably more so, since he seems to explicitly optimize for productivity to a degree I find unusual even in top-tier mathematicians), both garnered a reputation very early on for consistently solving really tough problems (the kind more naturally associated with high IQ than artistic creativity, more Gauss than Grothendieck if that makes sense), both have an impressive string of awards to their name, and both growing up were prodigies – in the most rarefied sense of the word. 

You know Tao's story already. Here's a quick run-through from memory: scored 760 on the Math portion of the SAT (99th percentile score) at 8 on his first try (only one other 8-year-old ever scored more than 700, Lenhard Ng, and it was his fifth try), youngest IMO medalist ever at 10 (bronze), youngest IMO silver ever (year after), youngest IMO gold ever (year after), graduated at 16, Ph.D. from Princeton at 20 under the renowned analyst Elias Stein, same year published his first (four) papers, full professor at UCLA at 24, Fields Medal at 31. 

Fefferman's story, interestingly, parallels and predates Tao's by about 26 years or so. In fact he was slightly ahead even. A summary: started college at 12, published his first paper at 15 (!), graduated at 17, Ph.D. also from Princeton at 20 under Elias Stein (!), full professor at University of Chicago at 22 (youngest at major university in US history), Fields Medal at 29 (youngest ever, since surpassed).

Although I'm a fan of Tao, I honestly think that some of the effusive praise surrounding him is a bit overmuch -- see for instance [the University of St Andrew's bio on Terry](#terry-tao). But even *that* doesn't compare to how Charlie was lauded back in the day. When I dug through old news articles on thirty-year-old Fefferman, I found the kind of praise that puts the above to shame: "perhaps the greatest mathematical genius of this century" and its variants popped up in the first two articles I found! Also others, like "certainly every mathematician in this country knows Charlie Fefferman". 

The anecdotes on young Fefferman strike me as representative of someone who wasn't just very good at math, but very smart in general. When he was four, the local auto mechanic at Silver Springs told his mom that "anytime the little kid wants a job here he's hired", since *by the age of four* he was already "better than any mechanic [he'd] ever met" (!).Later he took an interest in dinosaurs, and got so obsessed with them that his impromptu "lectures" on fossil exhibits at the Smithsonian to his younger brother reputedly drew throngs of followers. Tall tales, all of them, each as fun to read as the next.

Incidentally, Fefferman wrote the [laudatio](http://www.icm2006.org/proceedings/Vol_I/7.pdf) summarizing Tao's work leading to the latter winning the Fields. I like to see it as the passing of a torch from a Fields prodigy to another. Winning the Fields is rare enough. Winning it before the age of 32 – this sounds somewhat arbitrary, but by that I mean two cycles early, meaning you had two more chances to win it when older people past 36 have none, so you'd have to be really deserving of the award to take a spot from one of them – is much rarer still. I only know three. Two of them are Fefferman and Tao.

There's a quote by Fefferman of Tao that goes: "He's wonderful. There are a few in a generation, and he's one of the few." So are you, Charlie, so are you.

<a name="#johnny-von-neumann"></a>
### Johnny von Neumann
([overview](#overview))

From Cosma Shalizi's [notebook on Johnny](http://bactra.org/notebooks/von-neumann.html):

```markdown
Johnny, as it seems everyone called him, was one of those people who are so bright it's hard to believe
they were human. 

(Maybe he wasn't. There's an old joke about the Fermi Paradox, a problem which occured to Enrico Fermi 
one day at Los Alamos: where are They? If there are intelligent aliens out there in the universe, why
aren't they here yet? A million years is nothing, as the universe reckons things, but, judging from our
own track-record, a species only that much older than us would have technology which would blow our minds,
pretty close to limits set by physical laws. Leo Szilard is supposed to have answered Fermi: "Maybe they
're already here, and you just call them Hungarians.")

About the only large current of the natural sciences in this century which von Neumann's work has *not* 
added to is molecular biology. Almost everything else of any signficance he touched: mathematical logic; 
pure math; quantum physics; computing (which, as we know it, is largely his invention), cybernetics and 
automata theory; the Bomb; turbulence; game theory (another invention) and so economics, evolutionary 
biology, and the theory of war and conflict; artificial life, cellular automata (a third invention), the
theory of self-reproduction (which, with molecular biology, finally killed off any last lingering hopes 
for vitalism) and artificial evolution. What many of us like to think of as new and profound changes in 
the way science works, brought about by computer modelling and simulation, were forseen and called for by
von Neumman in the '40s. If any one person can be said to be the intellectual ancestor of complexity and
all that travels alongside it, it was Johnny. His only real rival for the honor is Norbert Wiener, a better
man but a less overwhelming scientist.
```

All this, in thirty-odd years. Von Neumann died relatively young, aged fifty-three, from either bone or pancreatic cancer. I’ve often wondered what else he would have accomplished had he lived longer, how much more he might have done. 

(I think I know now the answer: Johnny von Neumann would have probably been a richer man’s version of Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, and I’m not so sure about the “richer” part. See [here](#Andrey-Kolmogorov).)

The ever-entertaining Steve Yegge on Johnny, from his essay [Math every day](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/math-every-day):

```markdown
Von Neumann was originally "just" a mathematician (and chemical engineer), but he made lasting and
often central contributions to fields other than pure mathematics. Yes, he invented the computer and
computer programming as we know it, which is a fine thing to have on your resume, but it's only a 
tiny part of his work. The list is so long that the book I read couldn't begin to mention it all, 
let alone discuss it. I'll list a handful of his accomplishments here, but they don't begin to paint
the full picture.

Johnny co-invented game theory, made critical contributions to the field of economics, and extended 
his game theory to formalize the theory of linear programming, which is now a staple optimization 
method for many disciplines, including some that we employ at Amazon (e.g. operations research).

He singlehandedly invented the theory of cellular automata -- you know, the one that madman Stephen 
Wolfram tries to take credit for in A New Kind of Science -- and was one of the pioneers of methods
for understanding the human brain, which spun off any number of sub-fields.

He also did pioneering work in the theory of building large, reliable systems comprised of unreliable
components.

He was one of the key contributors to the atomic bomb on the Manhattan Project. He's the one who 
suggested the implosion device for achieving reliable detonation (they had been trying to use a 
gun/projectile method), and he was instrumental in working out the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic 
problems in understanding the shock waves and blast behavior. Regardless of your feelings about nuclear
weapons, you have to appreciate his contributions in a critical wartime initiative.

He made many major contributions to the field of numerical approximation. Many real-world problems are 
non-tractable to mathematical analysis; e.g. they're only describable by systems of high-order partial 
differential equations. Johnny tackled these problems with gusto, inventing or extending a huge number
of different approaches for doing approximations or probabilistic analyses that yielded results where
rigorous analysis had failed.

This is the primary reason that he went to all the effort to invent the modern computer. He wasn't 
satisfied with simply designing and building it; he used it to solve a huge variety of real-life problems.

For instance -- and this is just one example -- he turned weather forecasting into a science. Before
Johnny decided to tackle the problem (and he knew nothing of meteorology; he had to learn it in order 
to solve it), it wasn't possible to get accurate 24-hour weather predictions, and the experts in the 
field had given up hope of ever making scientific weather predictions. You now get accurate weather 
forecasts because Johnny decided it was an interesting problem.
```

Yegge On "what computers really are":

```markdown
Another realization I had while reading the book (John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing) 
is that just about every course I took in my CS degree was either invented by Johnny von Neumann, or 
it's building on his work in mostly unintelligent ways.

Where to start? Before von Neumann, the only electronic computing devices were calculators. He invented
the modern computer, effectively simulating a Universal Turing Machine because he felt a sequential 
device would be cheaper and faster to manufacture than a parallel one. I'd say at least 80% of what we
learned in our undergrad machine-architecture course was straight out of his first report on designing
a programmable computer. It really hasn't changed much.

He created a sequential-instruction device with a fast calculation unit but limited memory and slow 
data transfer (known as the infamous "von Neumann bottleneck", as if he's somehow responsible for
everyone else being too stupid in the past 60 years to come up with something better. In fact, Johnny was
well on his way to coming up with a working parallel computer based on neuron-like cellular automata; he 
probably would have had one in production by 1965 if he hadn't tragically died of cancer in 1957, at age 54.)

Von Neumann knew well the limitations of his sequential computer, but needed to solve real problems with
it, so he invented everything you'd need to do so: encoding machine instructions as numbers, fixed-point
arithmetic, conditional branching, iteration and program flow control, subroutines, debugging and error 
checking (both hardware and software), algorithms for converting binary to decimal and back, and mathematical
and logical systems for modelling problems so they could be solved (or approximated) on his computing machine.

He did much of the hardware and materials engineering himself, working closely with engineers to come up
with solutions for memory, secondary storage, input and output (including hooking up an oscilloscope to the
computer to visually check results that were too complex for punch cards). He secured the funding for building
the computer and computing lab from government and other sources, developed training programs to teach people
how to program computers, and worked with domain experts to find problems that were too hard for mathematical
analysis but tractable to numerical solutions on his computer.

Of course he knew what was computable on his machine, because he worked out new definitions of elegance and
efficiency, came up with the mathematical models for analyzing the complexity of algorithms being executed on
his device, and with his staff, ran hundreds of experiments to learn what worked well and what didn't.

John von Neumann invented our universe.

Then he died at the depressingly early age of 54, robbing the world of perhaps the greatest genius of the 
20th century. "Those who know" generally seem to rank Albert Einstein ahead of von Neumann, but Johnny
always gets a solid #2 vote. Frankly, though, I think Johnny had a far bigger impact on my life, and not 
just because I'm a programmer. What did Albert do, really? Dashed all our hopes of faster-than-light travel,
that's what he did. Whined a lot about not agreeing with quantum mechanics, that's what he did. To the best
of my knowledge, Einstein didn't even know EJB, which according to many Amazon folks makes him a retard.

When I say that von Neumann invented our universe, I'm not trying to be poetic or rhetorical. What I'm saying 
is that his *first* attempt at a computing machine, one that he didn't really like all that much and considered
mostly a prototype, is still the one sitting on my desk today. That means we're a bunch of frigging boneheads.
You, me, everyone.
```

More of the same from Yegge:

```markdown
Discrete math, data structures, algorithms: they've all been refined since he died, sure, but he started
it all. Virtually every discipline that we think of as "computer science" is like Euclidean geometry: 
useful, sure, but far from the only kind out there.

Operating systems, threads, and processes are just a pathetic attempt at fooling you into thinking you have
a parallel computer, right? Gosh, computers are so darn fast that you can have the processor zing around
like Feyman's hypothetical "only electron in the universe", and it almost looks as if we're smart. But we're
not. All the world at large truly understands is serial execution, which is precisely why we're so lost in
the whole distributed computing space. Everyone talks about agents and crawlers and web services and all
this other crap we don't understand; Johnny would have taken one look at it and invented tractable
mathematical solutions.

Compilers: now there's one discipline where Johnny clearly didn't have much influence. He was a big old-
school proponent of doing everything in machine code. He might have changed his mind if he'd lived another 
few decades; hard to say. But ordinary mortals realized they needed shortcuts: higher-level languages that
would be translated into Johnny's machine instructions.

So people came up with a bunch of crap-ass languages that still had the exact same abstractions as the
underlying machine: a global memory that you update by issuing statements or instructions, expressions
that can be computed by the arithmetic-logic unit, conditional branching and loops, subroutines.
Everything you need to be "Turing-complete", which is equivalent to von Neumann-complete.

The new languages simply added various shortcuts: named storage locations ("variables"), syntax for dealing
with memory addresses, "types" for telling the compiler that a variable comes from a particular set of valid
values and has a particular set of legal operations, "scopes" and "namespaces" for organizing your code a
little better, "objects" for anthropomorphizing your data so it can be happy or sad (mostly sad), and other
cruft.

Bu it's all crap. Why? Because it's all just sugaring for the capabilities of assembly language on von
Neumann serial machines, plus a smattering of support for calling into the operating system code so you
can pretend your program is performing truly parallel operations. And none of that parallel stuff works
very well, since we don't understand it, because we don't know math.

What about data structures, you ask? Surely that's one island of purity, something that exists outside of
the von Neumann universe? After all, we worked so hard to understand them. (Well, some of us did. Plenty 
of folks didn't even do that; they just call an API and it all works like magic.)

Sorry to disappoint you, but most of our data structures are fundamentally based on Johnny's sequential 
machine. Think of all those pointers: they're just memory addresses. The best you can do for a sorting 
algorithm, complexity-wise, assuming radix sort isn't possible, is n*logn. Or so you thought; there are
parallel algorithms that run in linear time. All your cherished data structures are simply the best that
clever people could do at organizing data on a Turing Machine. If someone created a set of data structures
whose pointers were URLs, that would be a step away from von Neumann.

What about SMP or NUMA? Surely adding multiple processors is a huge step towards parallel computing? Nope,
sorry. Well, not much of one. There's still a von Neumann bottleneck; the channel has just been made a bit 
shorter. We need it to be made infinitely wider by creating a truly parallel computer that doesn't consist
of CPUs all trying to update the same global store.

Face it: Computer Science was a misnomer. It should have been called Johnny's First Universe.
```

Yegge on Johnny "making intractable problems tractable":

```markdown
Mathematicians have traditionally avoided problems that they considered "intractable" to analysis. 
They've known about numerical methods for centuries; even Newton devised a few, as did the ancient Greeks. 
But brute-force methods have traditionally been met with some disdain, because the results of large-scale
human computations rarely justify the cost of the undertaking.

Clairaut's work in 1757, in which he and two other people labored for 5 months to trace the orbit of 
Halley's Comet to compute its perihelion, garnered widespread criticism after his team missed the true 
perihelion by thirty-one days. Larger-scale computing groups have met with similar results: you can perform
large, expensive computations, e.g. to create trigonometric tables, but humans make errors, and human 
computers generate unreliable output that becomes worse the harder they push to get it done faster.

Before von Neumann's programmable computer, mathematicians had few other options. They pushed pure analysis
to its limits, but some physical and natural phenomena can only be described with complex systems of 
equations that cannot be solved analytically. Many problems had to be solved informally.

Von Neumann changed all that; he embraced numerical methods and invented entire new branches of math for use
with the computers he was inventing -- the sequential computer for the most part, but also his planned 
parallel computers. And he was able to perform larger and larger computing tasks with small-ish teams. When
a task grew large enough, requiring more than, say, 20 people, it was considered intractable. Rather than 
trying to secure funding for more people, he and his colleagues went to work on creating intrinsically more 
powerful mathematical models to make the problem tractable.

And don't you think for a moment that his problems were "easier" than the ones Amazon faces today. Looking
at the speed at which he was pioneering the development of parallel computational models and research on
intelligent, self-reproducing, self-repairing systems in the last few years of his life, it's pretty clear
that he would have been successful. Johnny's approach was to make intractable tasks tractable.
```

This quote isn't that relevant, but it touched me. Steve Yegge in [Moore's law is crap](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/moores-law-is-crap.html):

```markdown
You *do* realize that John von Neumann spent the last 10 years of his life singlehandedly developing a 
theory of computing based on cellular automata? The computer you're reading this blog rant on was his
frigging prototype! He was going to throw it out and make a better one! And then he died of cancer, just
like my brother Dave did, just like so many people with so much more to give and so much more life to live.
And we're not making headway on cancer, either, because our computers and languages are such miserable crap.
```

Wolfram on von Neumann, from [John von Neumann's 100th birthday](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2003/12/john-von-neumanns-100th-birthday/):

```markdown
Some scientists (such as myself) spend most of their lives pursuing their own grand programs, ultimately in a fairly isolated way. John von Neumann was instead someone who always liked to interact with the latest popular issues—and the people around them—and then contribute to them in his own characteristic way.

He worked hard, often on many projects at once, and always seemed to have fun. In retrospect, he chose most of his topics remarkably well. He studied each of them with a definite practical mathematical style. And partly by being the first person to try applying serious mathematical methods in various areas, he was able to make important and unique contributions.
```

More from Steve -- he's interesting to read, because it's by one of the few people on the planet whose sheer mental horsepower was within striking distance of Johnny.

```markdown
Today (December 28, 2003) would have been John von Neumann’s 100th birthday—if he had
not died at age 54 in 1957. I’ve been interested in von Neumann for many years—not least
because his work touched on some of my most favorite topics. He is mentioned in 12 
separate places in my book—second in number only to Alan Turing, who appears 19 times.

I always feel that one can appreciate people’s work better if one understands the people
themselves better. And from talking to many people who knew him, I think I’ve gradually 
built up a decent picture of John von Neumann as a man.

He would have been fun to meet. He knew a lot, was very quick, always impressed people,
and was lively, social and funny.

One video clip of him has survived. In 1955 he was on a television show called Youth Wants
to Know, which today seems painfully hokey. Surrounded by teenage kids, he is introduced
as a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission—which in those days was a big deal. He
is asked about an exhibit of equipment. He says very seriously that it’s mostly radiation
detectors. But then a twinkle comes into his eye, and he points to another item, and says
deadpan, “Except this, which is a carrying case.” And that’s the end of the only video 
record of John von Neumann that exists.

Some scientists (such as myself) spend most of their lives pursuing their own grand programs,
ultimately in a fairly isolated way. John von Neumann was instead someone who always liked 
to interact with the latest popular issues—and the people around them—and then contribute
to them in his own characteristic way.

He worked hard, often on many projects at once, and always seemed to have fun. In retrospect,
he chose most of his topics remarkably well. He studied each of them with a definite 
practical mathematical style. And partly by being the first person to try applying serious
mathematical methods in various areas, he was able to make important and unique contributions.

But I’ve been told that he was never completely happy with his achievements because he thought
he missed some great discoveries. And indeed he was close to a remarkable number of important
mathematics-related discoveries of the twentieth century: Godel’s theorem, Bell’s inequalities,
information theory, Turing machines, computer languages—as well as my own more recent favorite
core NKS discovery of complexity from simple rules.

But somehow he never quite made the conceptual shifts that were needed for any of these 
discoveries.

There were, I think, two basic reasons for this. First, he was so good at getting new results 
by the mathematical methods he knew that he was always going off to get more results, and never 
had a reason to pause and see whether some different conceptual framework should be considered. 
And second, he was not particularly one to buck the system: he liked the social milieu of 
science and always seemed to take both intellectual and other authority seriously. ...

By the 1930s von Neumann was publishing several papers a year, on a variety of popular topics
in mainstream mathematics, often in collaboration with contemporaries of significant later 
reputation (Wigner, Koopman, Jordan, Veblen, Birkhoff, Kuratowski, Halmos, Chandrasekhar, etc.).
Von Neumann’s work was unquestionably good and innovative, though very much in the flow of
development of the mathematics of its time.

Despite von Neumann’s early interest in logic and the foundations of math, he (like most of the
math community) moved away from this by the mid-1930s. In Cambridge and then in Princeton he
encountered the young Alan Turing—even offering him a job as an assistant in 1938. But he 
apparently paid little attention to Turing’s classic 1936 paper on Turing machines and the
concept of universal computation, writing in a recommendation letter on June 1, 1937 that
“[Turing] has done good work on … theory of almost periodic functions and theory of continuous
groups”.

As it did for many scientists, von Neumann’s work on the Manhattan Project appears to have 
broadened his horizons, and seems to have spurred his efforts to apply his mathematical prowess
to problems of all sorts—not just in traditional mathematics. His pure mathematical colleagues 
seem to have viewed such activities as a peculiar and somewhat suspect hobby, but one that could
generally be tolerated in view of his respectable mathematical credentials.

Among several of von Neumann’s interests outside of mainstream pure mathematics was his attempt 
to develop a mathematical theory of biology and life (see the NKS book, page 876). In the 
mid-1940s there had begun to be—particularly from wartime work on electronic control systems—
quite a bit of discussion about analogies between “natural and artificial automata”, and 
“cybernetics”. And von Neumann decided to apply his mathematical methods to this. I’ve been told
he was particularly impressed by the work of McCullough and Pitts on formal models of the analogy
between brains and electronics (see the NKS book, page 1099). (There were undoubtedly other 
influences too: John McCarthy told me that around 1948 he visited von Neumann, and told him about
applying information theory ideas to thinking about the brain as an automaton; von Neumann’s main
response at the time was just, “Write it up!”)

Von Neumann was in many ways a traditional mathematician, who (like Turing) believed he needed to
turn to partial differential equations in describing natural systems. I’ve been told that at Los 
Alamos von Neumann was very taken with electrically stimulated jellyfish, which he appears to have
viewed as doing some kind of continuous analog of the information processing of an electronic
circuit. In any case, by about 1947, he had conceived the idea of using partial differential 
equations to model a kind of factory that could reproduce itself, like a living organism.

Von Neumann always seems to have been very taken with children, and I am told that it was in playing
with an erector set owned by the son of his game-theory collaborator Oskar Morgenstern that von
Neumann realized that his self-reproducing factory could actually be built out of discrete robotic-
like parts. (There was already something of a tradition of building computers out of Meccano—and 
indeed for example some of Hartree’s early articles on analog computers appeared in Meccano Magazine.)

An electrical engineer named Julian Bigelow, who worked on von Neumann’s IAS computer project,
pointed out that 3D parts were not necessary, and that 2D would work just as well. (When I was 
at the Institute in the early 1980s Bigelow was still there, though unfortunately viewed as a 
slightly peculiar relic of von Neumann’s project.)

Stan Ulam told me that he had independently thought about making mathematical models of biology,
but in any case, around 1951 he appears to have suggested to von Neumann that one should be able
to use a simplified, essentially combinatorial model—based on something like the infinite matrices
that Ulam had encountered in the so-called Scottish Book of math problems (named after a café in 
Poland) to which he had contributed.

The result of all this was a model that was formally a two-dimensional cellular automaton. Systems
equivalent to two-dimensional cellular automata were arising in several other contexts around the
same time (see the NKS book, page 876). Von Neumann seems to have viewed his version as a convenient
framework in which to construct a mathematical system that could emulate engineered computer systems—
especially the EDVAC on which von Neumann worked.

In the period 1952–53 von Neumann sketched an outline of a proof that it was possible for a formal 
system to support self reproduction. Whenever he needed a different kind of component (wire, 
oscillator, logic element, etc.) he just added it as a new state of his cellular automaton, with 
new rules. He ended up with a 29-state system, and a 200,000-cell configuration that could reproduce
itself. (Von Neumann himself did not complete the construction. This was done in the early 1960s by
a former assistant of von Neumann’s named Arthur Burks, who had left the IAS computer project to
concentrate on his interests in philosophy, though who maintains even today an interest in cellular
automata.)

From the point of view of NKS, von Neumann’s system now seems almost grotesquely complicated. But
von Neumann’s intuition told him that one could not expect a simpler system to show something as 
sophisticated and biological as self reproduction. What he said was that he thought that below a
certain level of complexity, systems would always be “degenerative”, and always generate what 
amounts to behavior simpler than their rules. But then, from seeing the example of biology, and 
of systems like Turing machines, he believed that above some level, there should be an “explosive”
increase in complexity, with systems able to generate other systems more complex than themselves. 
But he said that he thought the threshold for this would be systems with millions of parts.

Twenty-five years ago I might not have disagreed too strongly with that. And certainly for me it 
took several years of computer experimentation to understand that in fact it takes only very simple 
rules to produce even the most complex behavior. So I do not think it surprising—or unimpressive—
that von Neumann failed to realize that simple rules were enough. ...

I have asked many people who knew him why von Neumann never considered simpler rules. Marvin Minsky
told me that he actually asked von Neumann about this directly, but that von Neumann had been 
somewhat confused by the question. It would have been much more Ulam’s style than von Neumann’s to
have come up with simpler rules, and Ulam indeed did try making a one-dimensional analog of 2D 
cellular automata, but came up not with 1D cellular automata, but with a curious number-theoretical
system (see the NKS book, page 908).

In the last ten years of his life, von Neumann got involved in an impressive array of issues.
Some of his colleagues seem to have felt that he spent too little time on each one, but still 
his contributions were usually substantial—sometimes directly in terms of content, and usually 
at least in terms of lending his credibility to emerging areas.

He made mistakes, of course. He thought that each logical step in computation would necessarily
dissipate a certain amount of heat, whereas in fact reversible computation is in principle 
possible. He thought that the unreliability of components would be a major issue in building large
computer systems; he apparently did not have an idea like error-correcting codes. He is reputed to 
have said that no computer program would ever be more than a few thousand lines long. He was 
probably thinking about proofs of theorems—but did not think about subroutines, the analog of lemmas.

Von Neumann was a great believer in the efficacy of mathematical methods and models, perhaps 
implemented by computers. In 1950 he was optimistic that accurate numerical weather forecasting
would soon be possible (see the NKS book page 1132). In addition, he believed that with methods
like game theory it should be possible to understand much of economics and other forms of human 
behavior (see the NKS book page 1135).

Von Neumann was always quite a believer in using the latest methods and tools (I’m sure he would 
have been a big Mathematica user today). He typically worked directly with one or two collaborators,
sometimes peers, sometimes assistants, though he maintained contact with a large network of
scientists. (A typical communication was a letter he wrote to Alan Turing in 1949, in which he asks,
“What are the problems on which you are working now, and what is your program for the immediate 
future?”) In his later years he often operated as a distinguished consultant, brought in by the
government, or other large organizations. His work was then often presented as a report, that was 
accorded particular weight because of his distinguished consultant status. (It was also often a good
and clear piece of work.) He was often viewed a little ambivalently as an outsider in the fields he 
entered—positively because he brought his distinction to the field, negatively because he was not in
the clique of experts in the field.

Particularly in the early 1950s, von Neumann became deeply involved in military consulting, and 
I wonder how much of the intellectual style of Cold War US military strategic thinking actually
originated with him. He seems to have been quite flattered that he was called upon to do this
consulting, and he certainly treated the government with considerably more respect than many 
other scientists of his day. Except sometimes in his exuberance to demonstrate his mathematical 
and calculational prowess, he seems to have always been quite mature and diplomatic. The transcript
of his testimony at the Oppenheimer security hearing certainly for example bears this out.

Nevertheless, von Neumann’s military consulting involvements left some factions quite negative
about him. It’s sometimes said, for example, that von Neumann might have been the model for the
sinister Dr. Strangelove character in Stanley Kubrick’s movie of that name (and indeed von Neumann
was in a wheelchair for the last year of his life). And vague negative feelings about von Neumann
surface for example in a typical statement I heard recently from a science historian of the period—
that “somehow I don’t like von Neumann, though I can’t remember exactly why”.

I recently met von Neumann’s only child—his daughter Marina, who herself has had a distinguished
career, mostly at General Motors. She reinforced my impression that until his unpleasant final 
illness, John von Neumann was a happy and energetic man, working long hours on mathematical topics,
and always having fun.
```

The fullest version of the Dantzig-meets-von Neumann story I’ve seen comes from the [IFORS Operational Research Hall of Fame article](http://www.cs.xu.edu/~neyer/Math/NumberTheory/Research/VonNeumann.pdf) on the latter:

```markdown
Looking at von Neumann’s game theory mathematical results in terms of matrix and linear relationships,
one can see how and why von Neumann reacted to George Dantzig’s description of the newly formulated 
linear-programming model when they first met in 1947. Here is that story as told by Dantzig 
(1982, p. 45):

On October 3, 1947, I visited him (von Neumann) for the first time at the Institute for Advanced Study 
at Princeton. I remember trying to describe to von Neumann, as I would to an ordinary mortal, the Air
Force problem. I began with the formulation of the linear programming model in terms of activities and
items, etc. Von Neumann did something which I believe was uncharacteristic of him. ‘‘Get to the point,’’
he said impatiently. Having at times a somewhat low kindling-point, I said to myself ‘‘O.K., if he wants
a quicky, then that’s what he will get.’’ In under one minute I slapped the geometric and algebraic
version of the problem on the blackboard. Von Neumann stood up and said ‘‘Oh that!’’ Then for the next 
hour and a half, he proceeded to give me a lecture on the mathematical theory of linear programs.

At one point seeing me sitting there with my eyes popping and my mouth open (after I had searched the 
literature and found nothing), von Neumann said: ‘‘I don’t want you to think I am pulling all this out of
my sleeve at the spur of the moment like a magician. I have just recently completed a book with Oscar
[sic] Morgenstern on the theory of games. What I am doing is conjecturing that the two problems are 
equivalent. The theory that I am outlining for your problem is an analogue to the one we have developed 
for games.’’ Thus I learned about Farkas’ Lemma, and about duality for the first time.
```

This certainly sounds more reasonable / realistic than the version perpetuated in folklore, which has von Neumann (completely out of the blue, as it were) developing the theory in a 1.5-hour lecture to a flabbergasted Dantzig after the latter had just begun describing the simplex method to vN. JvN was (to quote Trump on Kim Jong Un) “a pretty smart cookie”, or (paraphrasing user ‘mathwonk’ on Ed Witten) “a little smarter than the average bear”, but the standard folklore version makes him out to be completely superhuman.

### Butler Lampson
([overview](#overview))

Alan Kay, answering [I don't want be a specialist. How can I be a great generalist in computer science?](https://www.quora.com/I-dont-want-be-a-specialist-How-can-I-be-a-great-generalist-in-computer-science):

```markdown
Every once in a while I’m asked “what does it mean to be a computer scientist?” My answer is “I 
don’t know exactly, but take a look at Butler Lampson. He is certainly the quintessential Computer
Scientist if ever there was one”. He must have been the easiest Turing Award winner to choose in 
1992 (the top recognition in computing)… Certainly in the top few of the most impressive people 
I’ve ever met, and especially to have had the fun of working with.
```

I found this really intriguing for three reasons. The first reason is that I’d been reading a lot of Alan Kay’s answers on Quora recently, and I liked that he was a dreamer of a pioneer who was good enough to make headway on those dreams — good enough to win him the Turing Award himself, in fact; Alan Kay’s one of the few people I wouldn’t hesitate to apply the overused word visionary to — and it took a lot to impress him, so getting singled out for such glowing praise from Kay (over the likes of Donald Knuth!) was certainly something. It also helped that Kay praises Lampson for being a generalist, and portrays him as being a true “end-to-end” contributor, which I liked since I’ve repeatedly said on [my blog](https://mosstuff.quora.com) that generalists and subfield-cross-pollinators and their kin are My Kind Of People.

The second reason is that it hasn’t been that long since I read [these two](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/math-every-day) [blog posts](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.my/2006/03/moores-law-is-crap.html) by Steve Yegge, and thought sure, JvN probably had more raw mental horsepower than anyone else in the 20th century, but he also had the advantage of being the first person to ‘mathematize’ fields that hadn’t yet been ‘mathematized’, so that there were low-hanging fruit by the bushel; what might he have done if he were born a couple decades late? At least if we confine ourselves to computer science (and since we’re using Alan Kay’s definition of computer science as the study of systems and processes very broadly construed, this isn’t even much of a constraint), the answer, judging from the way his peers all talk about him, in addition to his own [ridiculously long list of systems he’s worked on](http://bwlampson.site/Systems.htm), seems to be Butler Lampson. Seriously, go skim through that list and tell me you don’t feel the same way you do in going through JvN’s ‘known for’ list on Wikipedia.

The third reason was that on a lark, I decided to skim through some of his [lecture notes](http://bwlampson.site/48-POCScourse/48-POCS2006Abstract.html) for the Principles of Computer Systems course he taught at MIT, and I was struck by their no-nonsense near-incompressible density — I tend to be sensitive to fluff in technical reads, because I lose the forest for the trees more easily than most, which is why I make it a habit to summarize the heck out of lecture note-style reads online on a topic I get interested in; Lampson’s lecture notes seemed like they were already summarized, which gave the impression of a ton of mental horsepower.

(Also, see this: [Turing100 Event Report: Work of Butler Lampson - Systems](http://punetech.com/turing100-event-report-work-of-butler-lampson-systems/))

The quotes themselves are pretty fun — maybe not in the same ballpark as the almost-whimsical ones about von Neumann and Ed Witten, but not too far behind.

Various Turing Award winners talking about Butler Lampson at LampsonFest in much the same way Nobel Prize winners used to talk about Johnny von Neumann:

```markdown
Butler Lampson has as good a claim as anyone to the title of “father of the modern PC.” …

Lampson turned 70 in December; last week, a group of computer science luminaries gathered at 
Microsoft Research New England, at the edge of the MIT campus, for a daylong conference celebrating
his achievements.

Two major themes emerged from the morning sessions. The first was the sheer range of Lampson’s 
technical innovation. The other theme of the morning sessions was just how formidable — and, as
Metcalfe put it, “fast” — Lampson is in debate.

Sproull mentioned a unit of measure used in computer science circles, which indicates the “speed
of delivery of technical information” and is known as the lampson. “Most of us could ourselves only
achieve millilampsons,” Sproull said.
```

From [Cool jargon of the day](http://www.jargon.net/jargon/cool/):

```markdown
milliLampson /mil'*-lamp`sn/ /n./ A unit of talking speed, abbreviated mL. Most people run about 
200 milliLampsons. The eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems implementor highly regarded 
among hackers) goes at 1000. A few people speak faster.

This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes widely disparate) rates at which people can 
generate ideas and actually emit them in speech. For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell
(designer of the PDP-11) is said, with some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only talk at about 300; 
he is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as his mouth tries to keep up with his speeding brain.
```

More from Alan Kay:

```markdown
We find in Butler someone who covers in knowledge and skills a very wide range in computing and 
software engineering, who has not just designed/invented but also built operating systems, programming
languages, networking and internetworking systems, desktop media, specification languages, atomic 
transaction protocols, and much more, and hardware architectures and detailed designs for making hardware
... And more. A partial summary is here.

He must have been the easiest Turing Award winner to choose in 1992 (the top recognition in computing),
and is one of the few ever to have also been awarded the top engineering award, the IEEE John von Neumann
Award. He was inducted into both the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering...

Once in an ARPAnet design meeting in the 60s, Butler was supposed to give a one hour talk at the end of 
the day, but the meeting dragged on. When it was his turn, he looked at his watch and said “I’ve got a plane
I have to catch”, and proceeded to give the -entire- talk in 20 minutes, in perfect understandable English 
at great speed! It was shockingly impressive even from him. The person next to me said “It’s a great 
privilege to just know someone like Butler”. That talk — on a capability based operating system design — 
covered the content in a paper you can read.

Butler is also one of the clearest writers in our field. Here is a partial list of his papers over the years.
And here is the first page of his website with a few tips on stuff to look at that has been most popular with 
readers.

Certainly in the top few of the most impressive people I’ve ever met, and especially to have had the fun of
working with.

I think that — besides Butler’s obvious brilliance — there are a few keys to his range and depth, and many
of these revolve around -systems and processes- rather than hardware and software, or programming languages
and operating systems. Dealing with whole systems was in the zeitgeist of the ARPA community back then, and
it found Butler while on his way — after an undergrad degree in Physics from Harvard — to grad school in 
Physics at Berkeley. As he puts it “I walked in the wrong door and found people trying to debug code for a
new computer. And never found the doorway out”.

Butler was and is interested in -anything- that has dynamic relationships — systems and processes — (and
note the analogies with what is studied in physics). I think looking at the world this way — all systems
and processes (including physical and biological) — will round you into a “generalist in computer scientist” 
who can be a vital contributor not just a dabbler. There are only a few people around like Butler, but how
he has gone about his art can be and is an inspiration for the rest of us.

Leslie Lamport [talking about](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/part-time-parliament/?from=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf) how Butler Lampson was the only person to understand the significance of his Paxos algorithm:

```markdown
I thought, and still think, that Paxos is an important algorithm. Inspired by my success at popularizing the consensus problem by describing it with Byzantine generals, I decided to cast the algorithm in terms of a parliament on an ancient Greek island. Leo Guibas suggested the name Paxos for the island. I gave the Greek legislators the names of computer scientists working in the field, transliterated with Guibas’s help into a bogus Greek dialect. (Peter Ladkin suggested the title.) Writing about a lost civilization allowed me to eliminate uninteresting details and indicate generalizations by saying that some details of the parliamentary protocol had been lost. To carry the image further, I gave a few lectures in the persona of an Indiana-Jones-style archaeologist, replete with Stetson hat and hip flask.

My attempt at inserting some humor into the subject was a dismal failure. People who attended my lecture remembered Indiana Jones, but not the algorithm. People reading the paper apparently got so distracted by the Greek parable that they didn’t understand the algorithm. Among the people I sent the paper to, and who claimed to have read it, were Nancy Lynch, Vassos Hadzilacos, and Phil Bernstein. A couple of months later I emailed them the following question:

Can you implement a distributed database that can tolerate the failure of any number of its processes (possibly all of them) without losing consistency, and that will resume normal behavior when more than half the processes are again working properly?

None of them noticed any connection between this question and the Paxos algorithm.

I submitted the paper to TOCS in 1990. All three referees said that the paper was mildly interesting, though not very important, but that all the Paxos stuff had to be removed. I was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be, so I did nothing with the paper. A number of years later, a couple of people at SRC needed algorithms for distributed systems they were building, and Paxos provided just what they needed. …

So, I thought that maybe the time had come to try publishing it again.

Meanwhile, the one exception in this dismal tale was Butler Lampson, who immediately understood the algorithm’s significance. He mentioned it in lectures and in a paper, and he interested Nancy Lynch in it. De Prisco, Lynch, and Lampson published their version of a specification and proof. Their papers made it more obvious that it was time for me to publish my paper. …

### Grigori Perelman
([overview](#overview))

From Masha Gessen's biography *Perfect Rigor*, the "universal compactor" quote:

```markdown
Golovanov, who studied and occasionally competed alongside Perelman for more than ten years,
tagged him as an unambiguous geometer: Perelman had a geometry problem solved in the time it 
took Golovanov to grasp the question. This was because Golovanov was an algebraist. Sudakov, 
who spent about six years studying and occasionally competing with Perelman, claimed Perelman
reduced every problem to a formula. This, it appears, was because Sudakov was a geometer: his
favorite proof of the classic theorem above was an entirely graphical one, requiring no 
formulas and no language to demonstrate. 

In other words, each of them was convinced Perelman’s mind was profoundly different from his 
own. Neither had any hard evidence. Perelman did his thinking almost entirely inside his head,
neither writing nor sketching on scrap paper. He did a lot of other things—he hummed, moaned, 
threw a Ping-Pong ball against the desk, rocked back and forth, knocked out a rhythm on the 
desk with his pen, rubbed his thighs until his pant legs shone, and then rubbed his hands 
together—a sign that the solution would now be written down, fully formed. 

For the rest of his career, even after he chose to work with shapes, he never dazzled colleagues
with his geometric imagination, but he almost never failed to impress them with the single-
minded precision with which he plowed through problems. His brain seemed to be a universal math 
compactor, capable of compressing problems to their essence. Club mates eventually dubbed whatever
it was he had inside his head the “Perelman stick”—a very large imaginary instrument with which 
he sat quietly before striking an always-fatal blow.

<a name="#Alexander-Grothendieck"></a>
### Alexander Grothendieck
([overview](#overview))

From Barry Mazur's 2016 retrospective [Thinking about Grothendieck](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/papers/Thinking.about.Grothendieck%285%29.pdf):

```markdown
During the early 60’s his conversations had a secure calmness. He would offer mathematical ideas
with a smile that always had an expanse of generosity in it. Firm feet on the ground; sometimes
barefoot. Transparency: his feelings towards people, towards things, were straightforwardly felt,
straightforwardly expressed — often garnished with a sprig of morality. 

But perhaps the word ‘morality’ doesn’t set the right tone: one expects a dour or dire music to 
accompany any moral message. Grothendieck’s opinions, observations, would be delivered with an 
upbeat, an optimism, a sense that “nothing could be easier in the world” than to view things as 
he did. In fact, as many people have mentioned, Grothendieck didn’t butt against obstacles, but 
rather he arranged for obstacles to be dissolved even before he approached them. The mathematical 
road, he would seem to say, shows itself to be ‘the correct way’ by how easy it is to travel along
it. This is, of course, a vastly different ‘ease’ than what was an intellectual abomination to 
Grothendieck: something he called, with horror, “tourner la manivelle” (or ‘cranking it out’).

...

The mathematical talks I had with him—as I remember them now—were largely, perhaps only, about 
viewpoint, never about specifics (with the exception of a conversation about differential 
structures on conjugate complexifications of an algebraic variety over a number field). 
Grothendieck’s message was clear throughout: that everything important will follow easily, will
flow, from the right vantage. It was principally ‘the right vantage,’ a way of seeing mathematics,
that he sought, and perhaps only on a lesser level, its by-products.
```

His simplicity and hospitality:

```markdown
Simplicity was a great virtue for him, in ideas, in material possessions, in food. The main objects
in his living-room when he lived in an apartment at R´esidence Gratien, in Bures-sur-Yvette, were
a wrought-iron statue of a goat, a large urn filled with oil-cured black olives, a small somewhat
rickety table on which perched his typewriter (his work-space). You could meet him on the way
from market, during the weekly market-day in Bures, carrying only one (ample) bag of grapes,
eating them as he walked and offering them to you.

His hospitality was startling. Later, when he lived near the RER stop Massy-Verri`ere he once
invited an entire family who needed lodging, to stay in his basement and to bring with them their
in-laws. He helped them install a taramasalata machine there to give them some economic activity.
```

His attitude towards shopping malls and non-math objects in general:

```markdown
In encountering a shopping mall when he visited Cambridge (USA) his only utterance was an
Elizabethan “Let us flee.” How sparing he was in any activity other than mathematics during the
sixties. As a result, some of his non-mathematical experiences at that time had revelatory force
for him. He returned to Bures from Paris one day (this was probably the late sixties) saying that
he’d just seen the first movie he had seen in 12 years (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid)
and was struck by its moral complexity. The one non-mathematical book I know he was reading
with intense respect at that epoch was a volume entitled ”History of the Jews” (I’ve forgotten its
author, or the language in which Grothendieck was reading it). John Tate writes that Moby Dick
was Grothendieck’s favorite novel.
```

Leila Schneps' [Mathematics and creativity](http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/chap1.pdf) contains the following passage:

```markdown
Pierre Cartier observed that when Grothendieck took interest in some mathematical domain that he 
had not considered up till then, finding a whole collection of theorems, results and concepts 
already developed by others, he would continue building on this work ‘by turning it upside down’.
Michel Demazure described his approach as ‘turning the problem into its own solution’. In fact, 
Grothendieck’s spontaneous reaction to whatever appeared to be causing a difficulty - nilpotent 
elements when taking spectra or rings, curve automorphisms for construction of moduli spaces - was
to adopt and embrace the very phenomenon that was problematic, weaving it in as an integral 
feature of the structure he was studying, and thus transforming it from a difficulty into a 
clarifying feature of the situation. (p. 8)
```

Rene Thom, 1958 Fields Medalist:

```markdown
His technical superiority was crushing,” Thom wrote. “His seminar attracted the whole of Parisian 
mathematics, whereas I had nothing new to offer.
```

Pierre Deligne, 1978 Fields Medalist:

```markdown
When I was in in Paris as a student, I would go to Grothendieck's seminar at IHES... I enoyed the 
atmosphere around him very much ... we did not care much about priority because Grothendieck had the
ideas that we were working on and priority would have meant nothing.
```

Mikhail Gromov, 2010 Abel Prize Winner:

```markdown
(The IHES) is a remarkable place.. I knew about it before I came there; it was a legendary place
because of Grothendieck. He was kind of a god in mathematics.
```

Ngo Bau Chau, 2010 Fields Medalist:

```markdown
On arriving at the IHES, we ordinary mathematicians share the same feeling that Muslims experience
on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Here is the place were, for a dozen or so years, Grothendieck relentlessly
explained the holy word to his apostles. Of that saga, only the apocrypha reached us in the form of 
big, yellow, boring-looking books edited by Springer. These dozens of volumes...are still our most 
precious working companion.
```

Grothendieck on himself, cf dumb ox/sleight of hand:

```markdown
I've had the chance...to meet quite a number of people, both among my "elders" and among young 
people in my general age group, who were much more brilliant, much more "gifted" than I was. I
admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if 
familiar with them from the cradle - while for myself I felt clumsy. even oafish, wandering 
painfully up a arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I 
had to learn ( so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or 
following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright
student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most
forbidding subjects.

### Terry Tao
([overview](#overview))

The University of St Andrew's [biography](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Tao.html) of Terry has some of the more effusive (overmuch, honestly) praise I've ever seen for an active mathematician. I mean, look at these sentences, pretty much randomly picked:

```markdown
It is very difficult to write a biography of someone who is at the height of their creative
powers as Tao is. Anything that one writes about his research contributions will be quickly 
outdated as he is contributing major results in such a wide range of different areas.

[He] has produced such a fantastic collection of results, leading to the award of all the top
prizes in mathematics, that one must try to at least give a vague picture of the work of this
remarkable mathematician.

To dismiss this fantastic achievement in a single sentence seems silly, but there is so much
more to say.

Before looking at his contributions we note the prizes and awards he has received (although 
again this list is bound to become rapidly outdated as he continues to receive awards).

One might imagine that with his remarkable output of research papers, Tao would not find time 
to write books. However, this would be entirely wrong since he has produced both research
monographs and undergraduate texts.

But, amazingly, this still does not complete the list of Tao's 2006 books...

It will come as no surprise to learn that Tao, who is such an innovator in everything he does,
has created a new style of book. ...
```

Tim Gowers on Terry, in a review:

```markdown
Textbooks and popular science are still the two obvious niches for mathematics in the book market,
but the advent of the Internet has brought about a sudden change in the possibilities for mathematical
exposition, because now anybody can put anything they like on the Web. As a result, there has been a
rapid rise in a form of mathematical exposition that is too technical for the layperson, but much 
easier to read and enjoy for mathematicians than a textbook. A medium that is particularly well 
suited to this is the blog, and the undisputed king of all mathematics blogs, with thousands of regular
readers, is that of Terence Tao. 

Tao's mathematical knowledge has an extraordinary combination of breadth and depth: he can write 
confidently and authoritatively on topics as diverse as partial differential equations, analytic number
theory, the geometry of 3-manifolds, nonstandard analysis, group theory, model theory, quantum mechanics, 
probability, ergodic theory, combinatorics, harmonic analysis, image processing, functional analysis, and 
many others. Some of these are areas to which he has made fundamental contributions. Others are areas that 
he appears to understand at the deep intuitive level of an expert despite officially not working in those 
areas. 

How he does all this, as well as writing papers and books at a prodigious rate, is a complete mystery. It
has been said that Hilbert was the last person to know all of mathematics, but it is not easy to find gaps
in Tao's knowledge, and if you do then you may well find that the gaps have been filled a year later. Now,
in an interesting experiment, several of Tao's blog posts have been tidied up (partly in response to 
comments from others on the posts) and published as books.
```

From an article describing the award of the Fields:

```markdown
Terence Tao is a supreme problem-solver whose spectacular work has had an impact across several 
mathematical areas. He combines sheer technical power, an other-worldly ingenuity for hitting upon new 
ideas, and a startlingly natural point of view that leaves other mathematicians wondering, " Why didn't 
anyone see that before?" At 31 years of age, Tao has written over eighty research papers, with over thirty
collaborators, and his interests range over a wide swath of mathematics, including harmonic analysis, 
nonlinear partial differential equations, and combinatorics. "I work in a number of areas, but I don't view
them as being disconnected," he said in an interview published in the Clay Mathematics Institute Annual Report.
"I tend to view mathematics as a unified subject and am particularly happy when I get the opportunity to work on
a project that involves several fields at once."
```

Julian Stanley of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) wrote the following about Terry in his 1986 report [Radical Acceleration in Australia: Terence Tao](http://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10116), when Terry was still 10:

```markdown
On May 1985 I administered to [10 year old] Terry the Raven Progressive Matrices Advanced, an untimed
test. He completed its 36 8-option items in about 45 minutes. Whereas the average British university 
student scores 21, Terry scored 32. He did not miss any of the last, most difficult, 4 items. Also,
when told which 4 items he had not answered correctly, he was quickly able to find the correct
response to each. Few of SMPY's ablest protégés, members of its "700-800 on SAT-M Before Age 13"
group, could do as well.
```

Jonah Sinick expands upon Stanley's remark above in the following quote from his LW post [Innate mathematical ability](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5Xrv5aXfb95uHcseN/innate-mathematical-ability):

```markdown
People like Terry are perhaps 1 in a million, but I've had the chance to tutor several children who 
are in his general direction.

Descriptions of milestones like "scored 760 on the math SAT at age 8" (as Terry did) usually greatly
understate the ability of these children when the milestone is interpreted as "comparable to a high 
school student in the top 1%," in that there's a connotation that the child's performance comes from
the child having learned the usual things very quickly. The situation is usually closer to "the child
hasn't learned the usual things, but is able to get high scores by solving questions ththat high
school students wouldn't able to able to solve without having studied algebra and geometry."

A impact of interacting with such a child can be overwhelming. I've repeatedly had the experience of
teaching such a child a mathematical topic typically covered only in graduate math courses, and one 
that I know well beyond the level of textbook expositions, and the child responding by making 
observations that I myself had missed. The experience is surreal, to the point that I wouldn't have 
been surprised to learn that it had all been a dream 30 minutes later.

Tangentially, I don't know why we were assigned this problem, which is of considerable mathematical 
interest, but also outside of the usual high school curriculum. In any case, I remember puzzling over
it. Based on my experiences with children similar to Terry, it seems likely that his 8-year old self
would see how to answer it immediately, without having ever seen anything like the problem before.
Roughly speaking, an 8-year old child like Terry can recognize abstract patterns that very few (if 
any) of a group of 30 high school students with the math SAT score would be able to recognize.
```

Terry is very math-skewed. Back to Stanley:

```markdown
Yet at age 8 years 10 months, when he took both the SAT-M and the SAT-Verbal, Terry scored only 290
on the latter. Just 9% of college-bound male 12th-graders score 290 or less on SAT-V; a chance score
is about 230. The discrepancy between being 10 points above the minimum 99th percentile on M and at 
the 9th percentile on V represents a gap of about 3.7 standard deviations. Clearly, Terry did far 
better with the mathematical reasoning items (please see the Appendix for examples) than he did 
reading paragraphs and answering comprehension questions about them or figuring out antonyms, verbal 
analogies, or sentences with missing words.

Was the "lowness" of the verbal score (excellent for one his age, of course) due to his lack of
motivation on that part of the test and/or surprise at its content? A year later, while this
altogether charming boy was spending four days at my home during early May of 1985, I administered 
another form of the SAT-V to him under the best possible conditions. His score rose to 380, which is 
the 31st percentile. That's a fine gain, but the M vs. V discrepancy was probably as great as before.
Quite likely, on the SAT score scale his ability had risen appreciably above the 800 ceiling of SAT-M. 
```

Some other nice quotes from Stanley's report:

```markdown
Ten-year-old Terence Tao, or Adelaide, South Australia, is a prodigiously gifted young mathematician.
Julian Stanley, Director of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) at Johns Hopkins 
University states that Terry has the greatest mathematical reasoning ability he has found in 14 
years of intensive searching (Stanley, 1985). ...

In some ways it is ironical that such a profoundly gifted student as Terry should have appeared in
Australia, an obsessively egalitarian society where social antipathy towards gifted children and 
towards those who would set up special programs for the gifted is a powerful deterrent to the
establishment of state-mandated gifted programs. Two Australian states, Western Australia and
Victoria, do provide structured accelerated programs for highly gifted secondary school students 
within the government system, but these programs are under intense criticism from the teachers' unions, 
the media and many politicians. Terry's state, South Australia, has no such program; the few cases of 
acceleration which have arisen have proceeded from the interest and concern of individual teachers and
have received little or no support from the state education system.
```

Terry's father, Dr. Billy Tao, a pediatrician, "paradoxically" feels that in Terry's case the absence of a formalized structure may have been an advantage rather than a hindrance:

```markdown
My wife and I have been fortunate in having been able to work very closely, first with the principals 
and staffs of Terry's primary and secondary schools and later with the faculty of Flinder University,
to design a highly individualized program which has been tied in to Terry's levels of ability in all 
subject areas, not only in maths and the sciences but also in the humanities. If South Australia had 
already had well established gifted programs, Terry might have been drawn into a less flexible system,
quite different from what has actually eventuated. 
```

Back to Stanley -- the "typewriter incident":

```markdown
A few months after Terry's second birthday, the Taos found him using a portable typewriter which stood 
in Dr. Tao's office; he had copied a whole page of a children's book laboriously with one finger! At 
this stage his parents decided that, although they did not want to 'push' their brilliant son, it would
be foolish to hold him back. They began to borrow and buy books for him and, indeed, found it hard to 
keep pace with the boy. They encouraged Terry to read and explore but were careful not to introduce him
to highly abstract subjects, believing, rather, that their task was to help him develop basic literacy
and numerical skills so that he could learn from books by himself and thus develop at his own rate. 
"Looking back," says Dr. Tao, "we are sure that it was this capacity for individual learning which helped
Terry to progress so fast without ever becoming bogged down by the inability to find a suitable tutor at
a crucial time." By the age of 3, Terry was displaying the reading, writing and mathematical ability of a
6-year-old.
```

Terry's parents get involved with the South Australian Association for Gifted and Talented Children (SAAGTC), a group of teachers and parents of gifted students who run Saturday programs for gifted children and seminars and workshops for parents and teachers:

```markdown
Here, for the first time, Terry was able to work and socialize with other highly gifted children. Although
he met no one sharing his own prodigious math ability (this is not surprising because in terms of IQ alone
he is, statistically, one in a million and the entire population of Australia is less than sixteen million)
he was able to mix with other children who shared his hunger for information, his ability to assimilate and
integrate abstract concepts, and his delight in creative exploration. Even within the accelerated context 
of SAAGTC programs, however, it was found necessary to accelerate Terry still further beyond his gifted 
age-mates. 

I vividly recall one of my first meetings with Terry when, in my capacity as President of SAAGTC, I was 
informally assessing his mathematical ability for placement in SAAGTC programs. At just under 4, he was 
multiplying 2-digit numbers by 2-digit numbers in his head while I, the 'tester', required pen and paper
to check his answers! Another image springs to mind of Terry, one month before his 5th birthday, working
with a group of gifted 7- to 9-year-olds at an SAAGTC math workshop. The teacher challenged the students
to find the next four numbers in the sequence 9182736. Terry thought briefly and responded, "4554." He
was, of course, correct. The number sequence consists of consecutive multiples of 9.
```

Terry's "Fibonacci" program, written in BASIC when he was 6:

```markdown
At home, Terry continued his advanced study in mathematics. By the age of 6, having taught himself BASIC
language (by reading a manual), he had written several computer programs on mathematics problems. He is
a lively, creative child with a puckish sense of humour; something of his personality comes over in the 
introduction to his "Fibonacci" program, which is quoted in full by Clements (1984).

8 print "J" (This symbol means "clear the screen") 
10 print "here comes mr. fibonacci"
20 print "can you guess which year was mr fibonacci born?" 
30 print "write down a number please . . . ": input c
31 if c = 1170 then print "you are correct; now we start!": go to 150 
50 if c > 1250 then print "no, he is already in heaven; try again": go to 30
60 if c < 1170 then print "sorry, he wasn't born yet!; try again": go to 30
70 if c > 1170 < 1250 then print "he would be c-1170 years old." 
71 print "now can you guess?"
The program goes on to produce all the Fibonacci numbers up to the level requested by the player.
```

First publication, at 8:

```markdown
At the age of 8 years 3 months Terry achieved his first publication, a BASIC program to calculate 
perfect numbers.
```

Social experience in high school -- see concluding remark:

```markdown
Terry adapted to Blackwood High, and Blackwood High to Terry, with little difficulty. John Fidge, his
Grade 11 math teacher, found that after the strangeness of the first 2 weeks he was accepted as just
another member of the class and regarded as a friendly, well-adjusted, helpful and good-natured lad
by his classmates (Clements, 1984). This, when one considers that Terry was, even at this early stage,
finishing his work two lessons before his 16-year-old classmates, says much for his social skills. He
is a delightful young boy who is aware that he is different but displays no conceit about his
remarkable gifts and has an unusual ability to relate to a wide range of people, from children younger
than himself to the university faculty members with whom he now works. Billy Tao believes that the two
years of 'riding' several classes each term at primary school laid the groundwork for his being able
to cope with much older students later.

An important factor in Terry's happy assimilation into high school was that, because of his extreme 
youth, he was not seen as a threat, either intellectually or socially, by the 16- and 17-year-olds with
whom he worked. He was visibly not in competition with them for jobs, scholarships, or boy-girl 
friendships; paradoxically, this allowed him to be treated as just another member of the class, with
the very occasional privilege of getting a piggy-back ride from teacher during bush-walking excursions!
"I am now convinced," says Dr. Tao, "that it is in fact easier to integrate a highly gifted child into
a higher grade in secondary school than a lower grade and Terry was lucky that he started math in 
Grade 11 instead of Grade 8."
```

The key event that made Terry's parents delay full-time university entrance:

```markdown
The question now before the family is: What direction should Terry take? There is little doubt that, 
if he chose to enter university full-time, he would graduate in mathematics before his 12th birthday.
(He would, incidentally, become the youngest person ever to do so; currently, the youngest graduate is
Jay Luo who took a degree at Boise State University, Idaho, at the age of 12 years 42 days.) Terry's 
IQ has been assessed as between 220 and 230, and he has no areas of academic weakness. Even in English
and social studies, which he considers his weaker subjects, he is working at a level 4 years above his
chronological age.

A number of factors have influenced the Tao family's thinking about Terry's future study. In September,
1984, at the age of 9, he was invited, with a small group of senior high school students, to compete in
an Australia-wide math competition to choose candidates to participate in the Australian Mathematical 
Olympiad. Despite being the youngest candidate by a margin of 5 years, he top-scored in South Australia 
and ranked sixth nationally. However, in the Australian Mathematical Olympiad, which was held 6 months 
later, he lost his sixth place and consequently was not selected for the Australian team which competed
in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Finland, in July, 1985.

The Taos feel there is an important message in this result. "Terry's development in Maths has been so 
fast," says Dr. Tao, "that like rapidly growing grass in fine weather, he has not had time to put down 
deep roots. When he was faced with really challenging work at a level he had not encountered before, 
that was when the weakness showed up. However, it is much kinder to Terry," he adds, "for him to 'fail'
within his own state rather than at the International Olympiad where he would have attracted a lot of
attention, even among the other competitors, because of his extreme youth."

In May, 1985, at the invitation of Julian Stanley, Terry and his parents spent 3 weeks in the United 
States, visiting a number of university campuses, including Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Princeton,
Berkeley, and Stanford, and talking with experts in mathematics and gifted education. This experience, 
the Taos say, has helped to clarify their thinking on Terry's future education.

Terry's parents now feel that he should probably wait at least 3 more years before he enters university
full-time.
```

His dad Billy explains further:

```markdown 
There is no need for him to rush ahead now. If he were to enter full-time now, just for the sake of 
being the youngest child to graduate, or indeed for the sake of doing anything 'first,' that would 
simply be a stunt. Much more important is the opportunity to consolidate his education, to build a 
broader base. It is important for Terry to have a broad initial education.

I can see two different models of how his education could progress. The first is what I might call a 
"columnar" model, where his acceleration would be directed vertically upwards in maths and physics with
little expansion into other areas of knowledge. The problem here is that, although progress may be fast
and easy at the beginning, as the column gets taller it becomes more difficult to build on further 
knowledge, and, to continue the metaphor, the taller the structure grows, the shakier it may become. 

The other model, which we have selected, is pyramidical in shape, where Terry's work in mathematics and
the sciences is integrated with many other areas of knowledge. Initial progress may be slowed down while
he explores the relationships between all these areas of study, but as the pyramid gains height it becomes
easier and faster and the whole structure rests on a sound base of interrelated knowledge.

This broad base of knowledge is essential. At the highest level of any subject the boundary between
science and arts, between mathematics and philosophy, becomes less and less distinct. You cannot
enter this highest level of sophistication if you are too specialized. Even in pure mathematics there 
will be many problems which you cannot answer simply by applying mathematical techniques. Take 
Einstein and the theory of relativity, for example; it is not so much mathematics as concepts beyond 
computation.
```

Even at 10, it was already totally evident that Terry was simply a wonderful human being:

```markdown
Terry as an individual is almost universally liked and admired by the teachers and students with whom 
he works. Having had the opportunity to study the development of his personality over the last 6 years, 
I am sure that this warmth and acceptance are largely due to the gentleness and modesty of Terry's 
nature. He is able to talk frankly and confidently to strangers as well as friends, but displays no 
arrogance or conceit. His parents have taught him not to posture but, at the same time, not to conceal
his ability. Unlike most profoundly gifted children, he seems to have no difficulty in relating to 
people of lesser ability (Hollingworth, 1942). He has no conception of himself as "better" than others,
merely different. To Terry everyone is of value, everyone has something to contribute.

Terry's motivation to excel, to discover and to create is a burning force in his life. The results of
his endeavours--the award, the prize, or whatever--are of much less importance to him than the delight
of intellectual speculation. Billy Tao tells of Terry's reaction to the news that he had achieved the 
highest score Stanley had ever found for a child of his age, on the SAT-M:

I asked him what he would like as a reward and he probably thought that was a more difficult question 
than the SAT itself! After a few seconds he asked for a piece of chocolate which had been in the
refrigerator for some time and was almost forgotten. When I gave it to him he broke it into two halves 
and gave one to me. He was delighted with the result, of course, but there was no great celebration or 
anything like that. He was more interested in going back to the physics book he was reading (B. Tao, 1985).
```

Terry's capacity to analyse and comment on his own intellectual growth and development is surprizing in one so young. During his visit to Purdue University he spoke to the faculty and graduate staff of the Gifted Education Resource Institute about his early experiences:

```markdown
A couple of years ago I sat for a state wide maths competition for the first time. I was given 2 hours
to do it but I finished in 20 minutes and spent the remaining time devising a method to find the value 
of pi. Afterwards, when Mum found out what I had done and asked me why I didn't spend more time on the 
competition and check my answers, I just said, 'Wait till I get a prize!' Needless to say, I didn't get
any prize and I was quite depressed for a while. Dad later discovered that most of my wrong answers
were due to arithmetical errors. After that episode, I learned that I should always time myself during
an exam and check my work. Unfortunately, I still don't attend to the latter very well!

I discovered I could learn better and remember more if I taught my brothers what I had learned. So I 
taught one brother chess and the other music. My music has never been very good--in fact I hated it 
until I gave myself the motivation to teach Trevor. Now I actually quite enjoy playing duets with him.
I spent a lot of my spare time working out interesting ways to teach them, and I probably learned more
from teaching them than they did from me (T. Tao, 1985)!
```

John F. Feldhusen remarks on Terry's curiosity:

```markdown 
I had dinner with Terry Tao and his parents recently and was struck by the intellectual intensity of
Terry and his parents. Throughout the dinner Dr. Tao's conversation centered on Terry's precocity and
conditions which would facilitate his intellectual growth. Meanwhile Terry interacted constantly with
his mother about puzzles and about little curiosity experiments he was doing at the table, such as
holding a spoon in a candle flame. I was told by another family whose home he visited that he had been
extremely active in exploring things around the house. He seems to have an ever active need to be 
investigating and learning.
```

Harry Passow's impressions:

```markdown
I was fortunate to have an opportunity to meet Terence Tao and to hear his father describe the discovery
and nurturing of this mathematical prodigy. As I listened to Terence's father, I focused on Terence. Here
was a very attractive, alert, intelligent, articulate child who had obviously heard his parents discuss 
him and his development many times before and who, while bored with the discussion, seemed very patient
to me. Several times I tried to provide him with advanced mathematics texts on which he might work but 
they were not of the right kind and he soon closed them and let his eyes wander about my library and
artifacts.

The Taos left two documents with me which I have read and reread. One is titled, "My Recollections" which
is Terence's recollections of his early childhood experiences and consists of as he puts it, "some memories
which are very dear to me, some are actually a bit embarrassing, some funny, but most rewarding." The 
second is a document titled, "Reflections on Terry's Education," which is a talk which Billy Tao gave. 
Both are fascinating documents: Terry's because it conveys to the readers an impression of a very
intelligent, very insightful, and very sensitive young person. Terry concludes his little presentation as
follows: "I may be labelled as an intelligent child by some of my teachers, but I still have a long way to
go yet before I can become as wise as anyone of you here today." I read this after Terence had left my
office--but I could hear him saying it, seriously and sincerely.

Billy Tao's discussion of his son's development and education concludes with what he calls "the danger 
areas ahead," possible scenarios of what could happen to Terry. These range from Terry's possibly becoming 
"too big-headed," to his losing "interest in one subject, such as maths, and want to study another, such
as rock music," to the possibility that "he may burn out completely and lose all his brilliance, creativity
and productivity." A fourth possibility suggested is that Terry "may suddenly think that he had been conned,
that all his hard work, his good marks, had all been carefully orchestrated so as to fulfill my (his 
father's) own personal ego."

In my office, I have a card which talks about "your ordinary, everyday, run-of-the-mill genius." Terence 
Tao may or may not become a mathematical genius. He is certainly a mathematically precocious child with 
unusual potential and achievement. Moreover, he is, if you will, a "nice kid." I worried about whether he
was being exploited by his parents. Having met Terence Tao and his parents, I no longer am worried. Those 
of us interested in gifted education and, in particular, the education of what one of my friends calls the
"severely and profoundly gifted," will find the Taos a fascinating family with three children — one
mathematically precocious and another with learning disabilities but all being raised and educated 
intelligently, sensitively, and reflectively.
```

Stanley muses on Terry's skewed scores:

```markdown
How could Terry possibly learn mathematics and physical and computer sciences so well with only 
290-380V development? We of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) at Johns Hopkins have
discovered, chiefly by testing able 12-year-olds, that when the examinee's SAT-M score vastly exceeds
his or her SAT-V score the youth is almost certain to score high on a difficult test of nonverbal
reasoning ability such as the Advanced Form of the Raven Progressive Matrices, often higher than a high-M 
high-V examinee does. To test this out, on 6 May 1985 I administered to Terry the RPM-Advanced, an untimed
test. He completed its 36 8-option items in about 45 minutes. Whereas the average British university
student scores 21, Terry scored 32. He did not miss any of the last, most difficult, 4 items. Also, when
told which 4 items he had not answered correctly, he was quickly able to find the correct response to each.
Few of SMPY's ablest protégés, members of its "700-800 on SAT-M Before Age 13" group, could do as well.

Excellent nonverbal reasoning ability seems a necessary, though almost surely not the sufficient, condition 
for excelling in mathematics of the algebra-geometry-trigonometry-calculus variety at an early age. The
test-triad of SAT-M, SAT-V, and RPM-Advanced can give considerable insight into a mathematically apt youth's
intellectual powers. To those three I would add appropriate spatial and mechanical reasoning tests. For 
youngsters whose total score on a general achievement test battery of the kind usually administered in 
schools is high (e.g., 90th percentile or greater on seventh-grade norms), the 8-part Differential Aptitude
Test battery of The Psychological Corporation in New York City may be a good place to start.

### LeBron James
([overview](#overview))

From Redditor xdawsonic on the thread [[Serious] How young of a LeBron would the average adult male be able to beat 1 on 1?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6huci7/serious_how_young_of_a_lebron_would_the_average/):

```markdown
I played against Lebron a handful of times when he was a Freshman, so I have a little experience 
in this area.

I'll relay my thoughts about the game I remember the most.

I was 18. A senior, decent athlete, a few D3 offers, a few "preferred walk on" for some D1 schools.
I was 6'3-6'4 and 180-190 pounds. He was 13-14 years old, and and near the same size as I was.. 
but enormous feet, long arms, but lanky. Probably weighed... 170?

I'll try to keep it somewhat short... I could hold my own against him, only because he was very, 
very raw. I feel my game was as polished as it could be, while he was still just getting things 
figured out. We both ended the game with similar stat lines, but the X factor was just the raw 
explosiveness and athleticism... something you honestly can't account for when talking about size,
weight and even age.

I'm sure alot of you have played basketball, maybe even lately.. but you know that first few 
possessions of the game? Sizing things up.. who can move, who can shoot, how are they guarding us....
Lebron was already on a different planet in terms of just sheer velocity. He could just get off of 
his feet, make a cut, or grab a rebound while I'm still flat footed. He didn't have springs in his 
legs.. he had trampolines. I had played against alot of tier 1 talent at that point at 5-Star and 
Blue Chip camps, but the odd thing is.. I knew IMMEDIATELY that this guy was something different..
and that isn't just hindsight.

Anyway, we lost that game by 6. Which ended up being their closest game of the year (applause? kappa)
... Lebron got a steal in the last 5 seconds to close the game.. and traveled the length of the court 
for the final "nail in the coffin" dunk. I was so pissed of.. he wasn't going to dunk on our home 
floor... I'm going to chase this FRESHMAN down and foul the hell out of him. Now.. I could jump, 
could dunk fairly easily.. so I figured... I can do this.. plus we are the same size.. what could
go wrong? So I get to him (he sort of took a wide approach angle), jump... andddd he's clearly a
foot above me at the apex. Easily a foot. I felt like Isiah in that Celtics series this year. I 
quickly decided to just do what I could, and just wailed on whatever part of his arms or head I
could reach. The dunk failed, so I guess it was a success... but it was just another lesson I 
realized that game. This man is far superior, and he hasn't even hit puberty yet. This is also one 
of those days when I decided to not play basketball in college. A rude awakening to just how good 
you have to be compete.

Anyway.. back to your question... St. V was good that year with alot of studs, so Lebron was 
considered "the next big thing", but everyone knew he was different. I first heard about him when he
was around 11 years old, and I know he was beating people up at the courts since at least that age.
It's also important to realize that Lebron had absolutely NO "puberty" stage of being uncoordinated,
or 'weak', or anything of the sort. Maverick (Lebron's cousin / business manager) used to say that
"he's the one to watch out for".. back when we were maybe 15-16 (Maverick was trying to steal my 
girlfriend, who went to St.V..... Mav if you are somehow reading this... what's good man?)...

..so that being said.. all I can say is.. athleticism and that 'god given' freak-of-nature, all-worldy
talent is just something you have to 'witness' to fully comprehend.

An exchange of comments between xdawsonic and other Redditors:

```markdown
you should absolutely puff your chest about it. Say "I blocked LeBron James multiple times" and have
it on your tombstone. It is a technically true statement.

I was moreso elaborating on the notion that age 13 was probably the year any "regular" guy had a 
punchers chance to compete with him.

Definitely "regular" in quotation marks. Division 3 offers and walk on status at D1 is pretty impressive,
and it was still a back and forth for you too(that's what I got from the post anyway).

As a 5-9 dude, I doubt I would be able to beat a 10 year old LeBron.
```

User ay21690 played Lebron in junior year, when he was on his way to the second of three consecutive Mr Ohio titles::

```markdown
We had the chance to play SVSM at a camp during the summer of his junior year. End of the camp is both
a single elimination tournament, then an expo where coaches picked a handful of the top players to run
a pick up game.

2nd round, we kept up with them for five minutes because zero defense was played. Now I'm 5'10", but I 
feel like I was pretty (keyword was) pretty quick. We decided to run a triangle and 2 against him on 
defense.

He literally laughed in our faces and scored every single time. I couldn't keep up with him. We lost by
42 points, that was only because he subbed out at halftime and Romeo Travis chucked 3s the rest of the game.
```

To which xdawsonic replied:

```markdown
I'm actually glad I got to play against 13-14 year old Lebron... and not THAT version. I actually think
he was scariest when he was Junior. He played incredibly hard. Senior year was a joke to him, I think.

I was in attendance for the Oak Hill vs. St. V game (Carmelo versus Lebron) that year... and I couldn't
fathom that I was watching the same guy.

Lebron had 36 that game, Carmelo had 34.
```

NintendoJesus adds perspective:

```markdown
Man, this brings me back. I played against 3 future NBA players in High School/College, Jason Gardner,
Wally Szczerbiak, and Melvin Levitt. 2 of them washed out of the NBA, and Wally wasn't exactly 1st team
NBA but I think he made an All Star game or 2 and had a good career. Gardner was the only one I played 
against in a real game, the rest were pick up games at Miami OH.

Unless you have played in a game vs a professional athlete, I don't think it's possible to understand 
how different they are from us normies. It's like they are a subspecies of human that have evolved into
something better. Like X-men or something. They don't play the same game as us. It's like if you played
against 5 year olds in a driveway with a 5 foot Fisher Price goal. You can't double them, you can't trap
them, you may as well not even be there.

And like you, I was good, not just like "back in the day" good, but like legit good. I'm 6'4", played 
point, could handle it, could shoot, could throw it off the board and dunk in my sleep. To a random
passerby, I probably looked like I could play. But no, I was an insect, Wally once scored 11 straight
on me 2 games in a row.(We played to 11, 1's and 2's) He was so strong that he could just pivot and 
shrug his shoulders and create enough space to do anything he wanted. It was like playing against your
dad when you're 5 years old.

They indirectly ended my basketball career. I knew I could never be what they were. No matter what I did.
And 2 of these guys didn't even make it in the NBA. I can't imagine playing against Lebron. He's from 
another planet.
```

Massive14:

```markdown
I went to watch him play a state tournament game in person during I believe LeBron's junior year. It
was a regional game at The University of Toledo. What stuck out the most was his extra gear. It always
felt like all the other kids were trying their hardest, but he was such a good athlete that he was 
walking when everyone else was running, and he was still dominating.

When he went into that extra gear though, my goodness. It was like watching a grown man against babies.
There's only a handful of athletes that I've ever seen in person that could flip the switch like that 
(Michael Bradley and Sidney Crosby to name a couple, but not as extreme).

### Ed Witten
([overview](#overview))

Ed Witten is famous for having a great turbine of a mind.

He kick-started the second superstring revolution essentially single-handedly, has the highest h-index of any living physicist (that said, h-index is obviously flawed – see e.g. [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index#Criticism) and [here](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/10/10/whats-wrong-with-the-predicting-h-index-paper/) and [here](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/2013/01/01/whats-wrong-with-citation-analysis/), although see [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/49/19193.abstract) for an argument that it still has better predictive power of future scientific achievement than other indicators considered), is the only physicist to ever win the Fields Medal, etc. Here are quotes about him I can quasi-procedurally recall (don’t remember them specifically, but I remember how to Google for them) right off the bat – and I haven’t even been reading about him for a while. Regardless of whether or not you agree, they’re definitely entertaining.

Mathwonk, in a physicsforum thread:

```markdown
Obviously Witten is a little smarter than the average bear.
```

John Randolph Huffman Professor of Physics at Yale [writing](http://www.eoht.info/thread/5126785/Edward+Witten?t=anon) of his experience of working with Witten:

```markdown
[O]ne day Ed Witten said to me, ‘I just learnt a new way to find exact S-matrices in two dimensions 
invented by Zamolodchikov and I want to extend the ideas to supersymmetric models. You are the 
S-matrix expert, aren’t you? Why don’t we work together?’ I was delighted. All my years of training
in Berkeley gave me a tremendous advantage over Ed—for an entire week.
```

Peter Baida, a close friend of Witten back in Park School (his high school):

```markdown
I suppose it’s common that kids in any high school sit around talking about who the smartest person
in the class is. But we used to sit around — when Edward wasn’t there — and talk about how he was the
smartest person in the world.
```

Michio Kaku (whose bio is really cool) in an [article](http://edition.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/06/27/witten.physics/):

```markdown
I do believe there really is a category for a genius who is a supernova — a supernova that lights up 
the entire scientific landscape and that is Ed Witten…. I think he is as close as you are going to get
to a living Albert Einstein today.
```

Brian Greene:

```markdown
Everything I’ve ever worked on, if I trace its intellectual roots, I find they end at Witten’s feet.
```

“Max Raker”, commenting on the admittedly rather inane question “who’s the greater living genius, Terence Tao or Ed Witten?” in a [discussion thread](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/47/science-math-philosophy/greater-living-genius-terence-tao-ed-witten-663604/):

```markdown
So unlike most other people at his level, Witten didn’t really have scientific interests as an 
undergrad. The first time in which he officially had anything related to math/physics on his resume 
was when he started as a grad student at Princeton. I’m not even sure exactly how he got in, but i 
think within a few months he was working for David Gross. Gross was at this time likely the best physicist
in the world. Just before Witten joined his group, he had just finished some very important work on 
asymptotic freedom SU(3) and the strong interaction. This was work that he and his student, Frank Wilczek
later received a Nobel prize for.

So Gross was at the top of his game and also had good experience will gifted and Nobel prize worthy students.
Witten had a BS in History and had worked in politics. There are many stories you hear around Princeton 
about how frustrating Witten was to mentor. David would come up with a problem that he thought would take
anybody a few weeks to solve and require a ton of calculations, which a person sort of needs to go through 
to be educated as a theoretical physicist. Witten would instead come back in a day or 2 with a one page proof
that required no calculations and was based on some deep symmetry or other hidden but mathematically
sophisticated technique.

You can talk to some profs who were at Princeton at the time and as a school its produced its share of 
talent (including Tao) but I don’t think the faculty has ever been blown away like they were with Witten.
He must have had one of the quickest journeys from “I want to be a physicist” to “I am the most important
person in the field” in history.
```

Timothy Ferriss, in his book *The Whole Shebang*:

```markdown
In the high carrels of theoretical physics, where intelligence is taken for granted, Witten is regarded 
as preternaturally, almost forbiddingly, smart. A tall, boyish-looking man, he wears the habitual small 
smile of the theoretician for whom sustained mathematical thinking has something like the emotional
qualities that mystics associate with meditation. He speaks in a soft, high pitched voice, floating
short, precise sentences punctuated by witty little silences–the speech pattern of a man who has learned
that he thinks too fast to otherwise be understood. Though he is the son of a theoretical physicist,
Witten came to science in a roundabout fashion. He graduated from Brandeis College in 1971 as a history
major, wrote political journalism for the Nation and the New Republic, and worked in George McGovern’s
presidential campaign. Primarily a mathematician, he picked up physics along the way, almost as a hobby.
```

John H. Schwarz in an [article](http://discovermagazine.com/2008/dec/13-the-man-who-led-the-second-superstring-revolution):

```markdown
Witten is both deep and fast: After thinking through the ideas, he can compose an essentially error-free
100-page manuscript, often describing breakthrough original research, on his computer in a day.

In 1987 Michael Green and I coauthored a monograph entitled “Superstring Theory’’ with Witten. We were 
thrilled that Witten agreed to join us, since we knew that his contributions would greatly improve the 
final product. This work, consisting of more than 1,000 pages packed with equations, was completed in
nine months. For Green and me this required dedicating 100-hour workweeks to the project. Witten, on 
the other hand, was able to do his share while completing several major research projects at the same time.
```

Nathan Seiberg:

```markdown
I think in perspective of a hundred years or three hundred years, his name will stay…. It will not be
forgotten — his contributions are really lasting — contributions which will stay there.

He combines the rigor and precision of a mathematician with intuition of a physicist. But what is
really remarkable about him is the clarity of his thinking.

He shows the direction for the rest of us…. His main strength is that he’s powerful in everything. Both
in math — the most sophisticated math — and physics … he has remarkable physics intuition as well as
complete control over the math that is needed. And, in that respect, I think he’s unique.
```

Michael Atiyah:

```markdown
Although he is definitely a physicist (as his list of publications clearly shows) his command of
mathematics is rivalled by few mathematicians, and his ability to interpret physical ideas in 
mathematical form is quite unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community by his
brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathematical theorems.
```

Atiyah says a bit more about how it was like to collaborate with Witten:

```markdown
I met him in Boston in 1977, when I was getting interested in the connection between physics and
mathematics. I attended a meeting, and there was this young chap with the older guys. We started
talking, and after a few minutes I realized that the younger guy was much smarter than the old guys.
He understood all the mathematics I was talking about, so I started paying attention to him. That 
was Witten. And I’ve kept in touch with him ever since.

In 2001, he invited me to Caltech, where he was a visiting professor. I felt like a graduate student
again. Every morning I would walk into the department, I’d go to see Witten, and we’d talk for an 
hour or so. He’d give me my homework. I’d go away and spend the next 23 hours trying to catch up.
Meanwhile, he’d go off and do half a dozen other things. We had a very intense collaboration. It was
an incredible experience because it was like working with a brilliant supervisor. I mean, he knew all
the answers before I got them. If we ever argued, he was right and I was wrong. It was embarrassing!
```

Keith Devlin on why Witten turning 50 is “worth celebrating”, paraphrased:

```markdown
Witten’s work in manifold theory brings up yet another comparison with Newton. Neither of them were
concerned with finding mathematically correct proofs to support their arguments. Relying on their 
intuitions and their immense ability to juggle complicated mathematical formulas, they both left
mathematicians reeling in their wake. It took over two hundred years for mathematicians to develop 
a mathematically sound theory to explain and support Newton’s method of the infinitesimal calculus.
Similarly, it might take decades — maybe even centuries — before mathematicians can catch up with Witten.

For most mathematicians, myself included, the only way to convince ourselves that something is true
in mathematics is to find a proof. A very small number of individuals, however, seem to be blessed 
with such deep and powerful insight that, guided by little else besides their intuitions and a sense
of “what is right”, they can cut through the logical thickets and discover the truth directly — 
whatever that means. Newton did it with calculus. The great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler did 
much the same thing with infinite sums in the eighteenth century. Arguably the Indian mathematician
Srinivasa Ramanujan did something similar with the arithmetical patterns of numbers he discovered. 
And now Witten is doing the same with infinite dimensional manifolds. On several occasions, Witten
has made a discovery — a physicist’s discovery since it is technically not a mathematical discovery 
— that mathematicians subsequently showed to be “correct” by the traditional means of formulating a
rigorous proof. Given the complexity of the “insights” that Newton, Euler, Ramanujan, and Witten have
made — and the difficulty of the subsequent proofs — this cannot be a case of making lucky guesses.
```

David Kahana, in [an answer to a question on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Edward-Witten-know-so-much-math):

```markdown
In my opinion, Edward Witten had both an incredible working memory and an incredible long term memory
... it seemed that he already knew the solution of almost any solvable problem that was ever posed to him.

I had a friend who became his graduate student ... and Witten suggested a problem for him to work on. 

The poor guy worked for months, but made no real progress. Then he finally went to talk with Witten, 
who gave him  the solution immediately and in a short, and very simple way.

Genius can have a very nasty side.
```

The only non-effusive comment about him I've ever seen is this one:

```markdown
I don't think Witten is as strong a mathematician as a professional mathematician. Other than a proof
of Positive Energy theorem, I don't think Witten rigorously proved any mathematical statements. He
used the advance mathematics in his work, but Witten's genius is in seeing the connections. He showed
you can see knot invariants in as physical quantities in QFTs. Witten, with others, came up with some 
topological/symplectic invariants and these invariants arose as physical quantities in QFTs. They was
never rigorously defined and their properties were never proven in Witten's work. Which inspired some
mathematicians like Kontsevich to do wonders. 

He probably knows more maths than a smart beginning grad student in mathematics.
```

Robert Weisbrot [talks about](http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/2010/10/25/what-did-ed-witten-do-in-colle/) how Witten ended up in physics:

```markdown
I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had
been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that,
as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He
decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate 
school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out 
of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This
was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then
running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals 
like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him,
because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All
right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do?
Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, 
and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there–just after he had dropped
out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study
physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.
```

Ron Maimon on Witten's rise to prominence:

```markdown
He knew exactly what he was doing, politically and also physics. He was the first physics to understand 
the political lessons of the 1960s (and also the mathematics). Witten had a physicist father, a General 
Relativist, and this is where he made his early major, major breakthroughs (the positive mass theorem 
the bubbles of nothing Schwarzschild instanton, the gravitational compactifications of supergravity), 
he certainly knew General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics since high school, perhaps earlier, maybe in
middle school (once you learn calculus, some differential equations it’s easy enough to learn the rest 
in high school), he studied on his own (like almost every other decent physicist), especially mathematics,
in his college years, so he chose a bullshit major he could do in his sleep, but one he was genuinely 
interested in, because he GOT the politics of the 1960s, and he knew it was going to replace the staid 
Soviet/Eisenhower/De-Gaulle bureaucratic politics of the 1950s. He also just studied all the math he 
could, probably wanting to do pure math.

He did a bunch of politics and linguistics, but McGovern lost, and that meant it was going to be terrible
in the US for a while longer (nobody guessed how long). Physics in 1972 was still very politically
stagnant— the field was split in two, S-matrix and field theory, everyone was stoned and nobody was 
calculating anything (in Feynman’s words, from that era). Also, it had an atom-bomb stench, maybe that
was a factor, maybe not. It certainly was for others back then, who refused to study physics because of
the association with atomic bomb work.

Then in 1974 or so, it becomes clear this young Dutch guy named ‘t Hooft has renormalized gauge theory, 
and ‘t Hooft is producing monumental results left and right, on anomalies, instantons, new gauges, Feynman
diagram summations, 2-d models, everything. When he sees this (and he saw it for sure) Witten immediately 
switches fields. He applies to a graduate program in applied mathematics where he knows David Gross is
active (he has a plan), goes over to David Gross and talks physics to him, at which point Gross arranges 
for him to switch departments, and Witten is considered a phenom, because he already knows everything 
(it was a stupid trick in the print era– if you just read the literature, and you look like a genius— he 
was also a genius though).

Then he gets a PhD under Gross (who is by this time very famous, Gross knows S-matrix theory, he studied 
under Chew, but he is also a major leader in field theory, after asymptotic freedom, plus he knows 
condensed matter and does 2d stuff too, all things Witten expertly absorbed). He gets a job on the East 
Coast, at Harvard, where S-matrix and strings are taboo. Then he collaborates with all the big shots, 
Venziano, Coleman, and so on. Coleman is impressed to no end, and starts studying gravitational things 
in this era. (Witten is also doing great solo work at this point, like the nonabelian bosonization), and
the endless schmoozing and obvious talent and knowledge pushes his h-index to the roof.

Then he goes to Princeton, where he switches and supports string theory, bringing every other marginalized
voice up from the gutter, and now he is ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHABLE, politically, he is Albert Einstein. One 
cannot thank him enough for this, it was the most important political move in physics history, and that’s
not an exaggeration. He also does amazing work to push string theory forward from this point on, 
formulating open string field theory, finding realistic compactifications, and finding subtle physical
consequences of string theory which would give possible observational signatures. He also does amazing work
in all fields of high energy physics, and has pure mathematics breakthroughs.
```

Another Ronnism:

```markdown
Witten has contributed extremely significantly to mathematics, but so did Candlin with the Berezin 
integral, and so did Berezin with the proto-SUSY, and most significantly Pierre Ramond, who created
graded algebras. You can’t forget Ramond. And Belavin, Polyakov, Zamolodchikov and Knizhnik, who 
quadruple-handedly founded one of the most active fields of mathematics. Witten too, and Witten’s
contributions are closer to the center of what mathematicians find interesting, but you see how the
stupid politics gets in the way— he is praised so much, you can’t praise him as he deserves without
feeling you are neglecting other people.

The problem with mathematics is that the evaluation of quality is often by human judgement, not by
nature, and that can lead to politics too. That’s also somewhat true in physics, but physicists have
ways to get around that, by doing experiments, or by pretending to do certain experiments and then
breaking our head to come up with an answer as to what happens. The mathematicians have their own 
“though experiment” solution benchmarks, these are famous conjectures.

Witten solved many interesting mathematical problems of great depth, and also formulated and solved
many physical problems (one of my favorite works of his is the superconducting cosmic string paper 
from the mid 80s, another is a failed paper to try to solve the cosmological constant problem from 
the 90s, failed, but he gave it a major creative inspirational shot).

But stop trying to rank people on a line, it’s really stupid.
```

Ron on how Witten "knows so much math":

```markdown
Researchers are expected to learn the stuff they need, and be familiar with everything. Since this
is somewhat unrealistic, it just means you try to keep up all the time, and nobody feels they know
enough, you always feel like you're missing something.

Witten came before the internet, and one cannot overestimate how much more difficult it was to study
mathematics back then. When you opened a math book, if you didn't know the definitions, you couldn't
google them, you were just screwed. He studied mathematics (among other things) as an undergraduate,
I remember he was grateful for the proper mathematics education he recieved, but he continued to read
mathematics and internalize it also as a grad student and through his post doc and into his 
professorial career. He said he considered going into mathematics at one point, also perhaps
linguistics at some other point. He was a young lefty in the 1960s, there were a bunch of exciting 
things to do, but he eventually decided that physics was where he would make the biggest impact. He 
was up to date on the mathematics of the 1960s, that's extremely unusual for a pre-Witten physicist.
Now, it's expected, but it's expected mostly because of Witten!

All physicists know the elementary mathematics curriculum, that's no big trick. Most physicists have
mathematical competence in the areas related to their chosen field, to the level of a beginning
researcher. But what makes Witten special is his deep intuitive understanding of ALL fields of 
mathematics, especially deeply the 1960s topology stuff, that he clearly just learned for the heck of 
it, it wasn't before useful in physics, all the homology, homotopy theory and algebraic geometry 
constructions mathematicians were doing back then. It became central with string theory.

For example, one of his famous works in the 1990s was a note identifying the structure of brane anti-
brane annihilation as a type of K-theory, which is a Grothendieck construction which didn't have a 
physical intepretation before, nor is it something you would expect any physicist would know about.
Witten is the exception, because he knows the mathematics field as well as any mathematician, and he
just likes the material, he reads it, and rediscovers large chunks for himself.

While it is not polite to speculate about people who are alive (you can just ask them), I suspect he
learned a large chunk of advanced mathematics during his Harvard postdoc, in the late 1970s. Jaffe
and Coleman are influenced by him, probably the influence goes both ways, Coleman begins doing 
topological instantons, then he did the vacuum decay work, the false-vacuum instanton thing which was 
so influential for inflation theory. Witten is also associated with two enormous Harvard pure-
mathematics names, Bott and Yau. His mathematics had a Harvard feel to it, the 1985 Calabi Yau paper,
the Morse theory paper, these are popular Harvard topics.

He won a fields medal, and this is for a beautiful interpretation of the Jones knot polynomial from
large N 3d topological Chern-Simons gauge theory, a theory that he defined. In another related idea,
just a few years ago, he showed with his student or postdoc that the volume  conjecture (due to 
Thurston I think) is related to a property of these  topological theories under analytic continuation, 
and modulo the standard problem of precisely defining the path integral, they gave what should be a 
proof of the conjecture. He has a bunch of recent mathematical work I couldn't understand at all
related to pure algebraic geometry.

He also has a bunch of non-mathematical physics work too which are famous classics, like the
superconducting cosmic strings, the bubble of nothing instantons, the Witten anomaly, the Seiberg 
Witten theory and brane-stack constructions, the AdS/CFT constructions, a bunch more I probably forgot.
One thing that is not considered a classic is a 1992 or 1993 cone idea about supersymmetry breaking
that is very clever and simple idea for stabilizing the cosmological constant, but it probably doesn't
work (there seems to be a mistake, I don't remember what I thought it was), but boy is it inspirational.
it's really intimidating, as all his work is of extremely high quality, and everything is for sure 
required reading. It is a little difficult to follow, because it requires knowing earlier physical and
mathematical work, but it's as if it was made for the age of the internet, because now you can learn 
the associated material without being in a fancy place.
```

Ed Witten talking about himself sounds much more relatable. Consider these excerpts from [this interview for the AMS Notices](http://www.ams.org/notices/201505/rnoti-p491.pdf):

```markdown
....in those years, I knew about Khovanov homology and I was frustrated to not understand it, but I
had no idea it was related to geometric Langlands. I was frustrated at not understanding Khovanov 
homology, because I felt that my work on the Jones polynomial ought to be a good starting point for 
understanding Khovanov homology, but I just could not see how to proceed.

Eventually, however, some developments in the mathematical literature helped me understand that 
Khovanov homology should be understood using the same ingredients that are used to understand geometric
Langlands. I didn’t understand all of these clues, but I learned from two of them. .... I did not 
initially know what to make of those clues, but they were a sort of red flag hanging out there.
```

Or this:

```markdown
If one knows even a little bit about the Langlands correspondence and a little bit about conformal 
field theory on a Riemann surface, one can see an analogy between them. I wrote a paper that was
motivated by that, but then I realized that my understanding was too superficial to lead to
anything deep, so I abandoned the matter for a number of years.
```

Or this:

```markdown
The work of Beilinson and Drinfeld on geometric Langlands bothered me.... They were using familiar
ingredients of physics, but they were using them in ways that did not seem to fit. It looked like
somebody had taken a bunch of chess pieces, or perhaps here in Japan I should say a bunch of shogi
pieces, and placed them on the board at random. The way that the pieces were arranged did not make
any sense to me. That bothered me, but I could not do anything about it.
```

Or this:

```markdown
Although I understood scarcely anything of what Beilinson and Drinfeld were saying, I did put them
in touch with Hitchin’s work, and actually, in their very long, unpublished foundational paper on 
geometric Langlands that you can find on the Web, Beilinson and Drinfeld acknowledged me very
generously, far overestimating how much I had understood. All that had really happened was that 
based on a guess, I told them about Hitchin’s work, and then I think that made all kinds of things
obvious to them. Maybe they felt I knew some of those things, but I didn’t.
```

Or this:

```markdown
There were two long series of lectures and then there were a couple of outliers. The long series
were very well done, but they did not help me very much.

In addition, Ed Frenkel.... gave a series of lectures that, as far as I was concerned, were basically
about the shogi board on which the pieces have been arranged at random. I really couldn’t get much 
out of those lectures either, because I already knew that people working on the geometric Langlands
were taking familiar pieces from the shogi set and arranging them on the board at random as far as
I was concerned.
```

Or this:

```markdown
I personally concentrated on geometric Langlands rather than on number theory, and geometric Langlands
was hard enough..... For example, I did not understand what Hiraku Nakajima explained yesterday at 
the Kyoto Prize Workshop.
```

Or this:

```markdown
In some cases, I am still struggling to understand things that physicists did quite some time ago
that are very relevant. Just to give one example, the Gopakumar-Vafa and Ooguri-Vafa formulas 
have been very influential for algebraic geometers, but as a physicist, I was never satisfied
that I understood them. So I actually spent a lot of time in the last year with a student (Mykola
Dedushenko) trying to understand these formulas better. In this work, I was doing some of the
