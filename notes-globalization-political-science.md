## What is this?

This is the "globalization and political science" section of [this notebook](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/quotes.md), last updated Apr 6, 2019, which got so big (1.2 million char) that GitHub refused to render the whole page anymore, ruining my original dream of having my entire notebook in one long page for two purposes: (1) zero-latency clickthrough to make up for my working memory's sand-thru-sieve transience; (2) lower activation energy for continuous document-wide refactoring, to aid recall and cross-domain interlinking.

That said, this is a "living document", a "perpetual draft" in [the style of Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content). I'm particulary taken by the following quote: 

```markdown
I have read blogs for many years and most blog posts are the triumph of the hare over the tortoise.
They are meant to be read by a few people on a weekday in 2004 and never again, and are quickly
abandoned—and perhaps as Assange says, not a moment too soon. (But isn’t that sad? Isn’t it a 
terrible ROI for one’s time?) On the other hand, the best blogs always seem to be building something:
they are rough drafts—works in progress. (EY's early contributions to LW is an example; Robin 
Hanson's OB blog is the *anti*-example.) 

I did not wish to write a blog. Then what? More than just “evergreen content”, what would constitute 
Long Content as opposed to the existing culture of Short Content? How does one live in a Long Now 
sort of way?

My answer is that one uses such a framework to work on projects that are too big to work on normally
or too tedious. ...Knowing your site will survive for decades to come gives you the mental wherewithal
to tackle long-term tasks like gathering information for years, and such persistence can be useful --
if one holds onto every glimmer of genius for years, then even the dullest person may look a bit like
a genius himself. Half the challenge of fighting procrastination is the pain of starting—I find when 
I actually get into the swing of working on even dull tasks, it’s not so bad. 

So this suggests a solution: never start. Merely have perpetual drafts, which one tweaks from time to
time. And the rest takes care of itself.
```

There's also this quote from Paul Graham's essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html), [paraphrased](https://meltingasphalt.com/about/) by Kevin Simler:

```markdown
An obstacle downstream propagates upstream. If you're not allowed to implement new ideas, 
you stop having them. And vice versa: when you can do whatever you want, you have more 
ideas about what to do. So [keeping a blog] makes your brain more powerful in the same way
a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.
```

This is my first experiment in Gwern's vein. The quotes here have been collected over more than half a decade, albeit in different pages. I intend for them to shape my worldview; doing so like this allows, or so I hope, the shaping to be more fine-grained and guided than the recency-weighted randomness of normal worldview-shaping. (Or at least that was the original intent before I had to break up the notebook. Now I'm not so sure I can do this.)

I also really, *really* hate experiences of the [Jeremy Bentham type](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/notes-amazing-people.md#Jeremy-bentham). This document is intended to prevent them from happening again.

Besides Gwern Branwen, [Cosma Shalizi's notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) (indeed his [entire oeuvre](http://bactra.org/)) are another major inspiration behind this document.

## Overview

I've sorted the quotes below into the following categories. This is a provisional taxonomy, subject to perpetual refactoring. The reason it has a [Borgesian flavor](https://github.com/monastri/monastri.github.io/blob/master/poetry.md#the-celestial-emporium-of-benevolent-knowledge) is that it's meant to aid recall and idea-building. The categories are ordered alphabetically; the actual quotes (the top-level categories that is) are chronologically added.

### Chinese perspective on Western elite
([overview](#overview))

I love how Puzhong Yao comes across in his essay [The Western Elite from a Chinese Perspective](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/11/western-elite-chinese-perspective/), about his experiences at Goldman Sachs, Cambridge and Stanford. He’s so honest and straight-laced he reminds me of myself before I ‘got more sophisticated’ in order to ‘navigate the turbulent realities of daily workplace politics’ (well, minimally, so I don’t drown). Here are some quotes I especially liked.

Result over process:

```markdown
My job at Goldman was a mixture of making markets to facilitate client trades and finding trades
for the bank’s own book. In early 2009, I believed it was an excellent trade to go long UK 
inflation. In fact, I thought it was such a good trade that my biggest worry was that there 
wouldn’t be anyone who would want to be on the other side of it. Yet we managed to put this
trade on versus a British bank. In the following year, the trade worked wonders, with UK 
inflation steadily rising, making the bank tens of millions in profits.

I thought I was an amazing trader. But there was a slight problem: I wanted to do the trade 
because I thought the market was pricing UK interest rates to go up. And when interest rates go 
up, UK inflation would rise mechanically due to the way it is defined and calculated. But in that
year, the Bank of England didn’t raise interest rates at all. Rather, the increase in inflation 
was due to things like tax increases, exchange rate fluctuations, oil price moves, etc.—things I
didn’t anticipate at all. It was pure luck that I made money, and I made it for the wrong reason.

When I was an intern, in one of the training presentations, a senior banker told us to distinguish
between the process and the results. He said that we should focus on the process, which we can
control, rather than the result, which is subject to luck. And here at Goldman, he said, we don’t
punish people for losing money for the right reason. I have always loved asking questions, so I 
asked him, was anyone ever punished for making money for the wrong reason? After giving it some
thought, he said that he had not heard of any such thing. And he was right. In fact, no one seemed
to remember the reason I did the inflation trade at all. They only remembered that I did this trade
and that it worked well.

When I met with my manager for a performance review after this, I was expecting to be berated for
my poor judgment. Instead, I got promoted! I told my manager that it was a mistake, but he merely
said, “Puzhong, tell no one.” He too was promoted on the basis of managing my “brilliant” trade. 
In fact, my manager was so proud of my work he recommended me to Stanford’s prestigious Graduate 
School of Business (GSB), and I soon set off for America.

Mottos as an example of Robin Hanson's "X isn't about Y":

```markdown
One class was about strategy. It focused on how corporate mottos and logos could inspire employees.
Many of the students had worked for nonprofits or health care or tech companies, all of which had 
mottos about changing the world, saving lives, saving the planet, etc. The professor seemed to like
these mottos.

I told him that at Goldman our motto was “be long-term greedy.” The professor couldn’t understand
this motto or why it was inspiring. I explained to him that everyone else in the market was short-term 
greedy and, as a result, we took all their money. Since traders like money, this was inspiring.

He asked if perhaps there was another motto or logo that my other classmates might connect with. I
told him about the black swan I kept on my desk as a reminder that low probability events happen with
high frequency.

He didn’t like that motto either and decided to call on another student, who had worked at Pfizer. 
Their motto was “all people deserve to live healthy lives.” The professor thought this was much better.

I didn’t understand how it would motivate employees, but this was exactly why I had come to Stanford:
to learn the key lessons of interpersonal communication and leadership.
```

On the importance of showing that you feel strongly about something, else it shows you aren't taking it seriously:

```markdown
On the communication and leadership front, I came to the GSB knowing I was not good and hoped to 
get better. My favorite class was called “Interpersonal Dynamics” or, as students referred to it,
“Touchy Feely.” In “Touchy Feely,” students get very candid feedback on how their words and actions 
affect others in a small group that meets several hours per week for a whole quarter.

We talked about microaggressions and feelings and empathy and listening. Sometimes in class the 
professor would say things to me like “Puzhong, when Mary said that, I could see you were really 
feeling something,” or “Puzhong, I could see in your eyes that Peter’s story affected you.” And I 
would tell them I didn’t feel anything. I was quite confused.

One of the papers we studied mentioned that subjects are often not conscious of their own feelings 
when fully immersed in a situation. But body indicators such as heart rate would show whether the 
person is experiencing strong emotions. I thought that I generally didn’t have a lot of emotions and
decided that this might be a good way for me to discover my hidden emotions that the professor kept
asking about.

So I bought a heart rate monitor and checked my resting heart rate. Right around 78. And when the 
professor said to me in class “Puzhong, I can see that story brought up some emotions in you,” I
rolled up my sleeve and checked my heart rate. It was about 77. And so I said, “nope, no emotion.” 
The experiment seemed to confirm my prior belief: my heart rate hardly moved, even when I was
criticized, though it did jump when I became excited or laughed.

This didn’t land well on some of my classmates. They felt I was not treating these matters with the
seriousness that they deserved. The professor was very angry. My takeaway was that my interpersonal
skills were so bad that I could easily offend people unintentionally, so I concluded that after 
graduation I should do something that involved as little human interaction as possible.
